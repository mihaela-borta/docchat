###### Abstract

The practical benefits of conducting evaluations of acoustical scenes in laboratory settings are evident in the literature. Such approaches, however, may implicate an audio-visual incongruuity, as assessors are physically in a laboratory room, whilst auditioning another, e.g., an auditorium. In this report it is hypothesised that presenting congruent audio-visual stimuli in VR improves the experience of an auralised sound field. Measured sound fields were reproduced over a 3D loudspeaker-array. Expert assessors evaluated those in two visual conditions: a congruent room, and a dark environment. Although a tendency towards improved plausibility and decreased task-difficulty for congruent conditions could be seen, visual conditions did not reveal a statistical significance indicating the need of further experiments with a larger sample-size, interface improvements, and realistic graphics.

## 1 Introduction

Listening tests are a very useful tool for satisfying customer's subjective demands in the audio products market. Standard listening tests procedures normally occur in specially designed rooms that resemble the _in-situ_ conditions, i.e. the environmental conditions where the audio product is meant to be used. Naturally, this approach provides the most ecologically valid scenario as listeners experience the sound fields as they would in real life. However, this approach has a remarkable limitation: comparing different rooms or multiple loudspeaker placements imposes long test-to-test periods, which is impractical, and it is known to negatively impact assessors' judgements [1] and mental capacity due to the human limited auditory memory [2].

Laboratory-based listening tests make use of spatial audio technologies to recreate previously captured sound fields, in a neutral environment such as a sound booth, over headphones or a loudspeaker system. Such apparatus allows for instant comparisons between multiple stimuli, without physical movement of the listener, allowing repeatable and scientifically-valid experimental frameworks to be followed. If one considers the evaluation of real sound fields, for example the sound of an orchestra in a concert hall, a laboratory-based set up is likely to introduce an audio-visual incongruuity: what the listener sees, does not necessarily match what
