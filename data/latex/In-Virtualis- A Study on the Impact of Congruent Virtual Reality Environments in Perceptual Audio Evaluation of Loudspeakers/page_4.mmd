data through a numerical scale.

Likewise, the overall experience attributes,i.e., Plausibility, Difficulty, and QoE, were evaluated also by means of ratings with the CQS. As these attributes required some interpretation, definitions were given before the experiment and then displayed on the interface during the experiment. The labels for each scale interval were also the same used for the listening test, except for difficulty, in which they were substituted for the followings: _Extremely Difficult, Difficult, Medium Level, Easy, Extremely Easy_. The three different attributes were distributed in three test pages, also with randomised order, presenting the first of them immediately after completing the last listening test page. The time spent completing the test was also recorded for each participant. It was assumed that time could be used as an indicator for assessing any variation in efficiency.

During the whole duration of the experiment, the experimenter could see on a computer screen what the participants were seeing in the VR environment, and thus keep track of their activity and be able to identify any possible issue. Finally, a usability questionnaire, based on the _USE (Usable, Satisfying, Easy) Scorecard for AR and VR_ method developed by the _Interaction Design Foundation2_, was included at the end of the experiment. The questionnaire included also, previously and after the experiment, a list of common cybersickness symptoms [15, 16] for the participant to check if feeling any of them. Thus, it could be analysed if the system was causing any symptoms.

Regarding the selection of the listening panel, the ITU recommendation [14] states that data from listening tests should come from expert assessors, even when the test method are not intended for small impairments. Expert assessors are understood as people who is widely experienced in listening to sounds in a critical manner. Unequivocally, the general population, i.e. the costumers, is actually represented by non-expert listeners. However, after long-term exposure to the audio product, non-experts tend to become experts [17]. Thus, tests using experts are expected to give a more reliable and faster indication of the results that will come out in the long term.

### Assessors

Nine male expert assessors (N=9), with average age M=49.7 (s.d.=12.77), took part in the experiment as volunteers. All assessors had been involved in acoustic design, audio development, tuning and/or mixing for more than 7 years, and 57% for 30 years or more. They had all conducted experiments before with 67% reported to be very experienced, and 33% self-reported good hearing. Regarding experience with VR, 11.1% had used it several times, 56% a few times and 33% never used it before.

### Experimental Apparatus & Materials

#### 2.2.1 Acquisition of Sound Fields

_In-situ_ measurements were conducted in a controlled listening environment (7.6\(\times\)6.5\(\times\)2.4m, RT\({}_{30}\) = 0.5 s), resembling a living room. In order to obtain Spatial Room Impulse Responses (SRIR) of a varying sound field, two speaker systems were used as excitation sources. A pair of of high-end speakers with variable directivity capabilities, placed in 2-channel stereophonic configuration (B=5.15), and a single premium portable speaker, placed in the centre. A microphone array with 6 near-coincident capsules (G.R.A.S, VI-50) was placed in the central listening position (B = D = 5.15) and captured the sound field for each source individually. To obtain the IR, a 10 s sine-sweep was reproduced by the source and it was recorded at 192kHz by RME UFX+. Three acoustical conditions were captured in total. Source A refers to the field captured by a single conventional source system in the centre of stereophonic layout. Source B and Source C refer to the captured field that was excited by a pair of high-end sources, placed in a 2-channel stereophonic configuration, in a narrow directivity setting (\(\pm\) 45 deg.) and an omnidirectional setting (\(\pm\) 180 deg.) respectively.

#### 2.2.2 Presentation of Sound Fields

In order to spatially reproduce the captured SRIR, Spatial Decomposition Method (SDM) [18] was employed for the analysis and synthesis of the fields. SDM estimates the _Direction Of Arrival_ (DOA) for each discrete time step, in short time windows. The resultant DOA from this process, is then combined with the captured pressure. This information is then used to spatially synthesise the sound field by means of a parametric rendering scheme.

A 3D spherical loudspeaker array, consisting of 40 full-range loudspeakers (35 \(\times\) Genelec 8320, 5\(\times\) Genelec 8331) and 4 subwoofers (Genelec 7350), was used to
