listening tests' naturalness, and in consequence its ecological validity. The concept of plausibility in VR was introduced in order to asses the degree of naturalness, and it was also hypothesised that a more plausible perceptual experience will reduce the difficulty of assessing and consequently the time required to complete the tests. Moreover, QoE was introduced as a global indicator of the quality of listening test as an experience.

In order to investigate this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted that duplicated the set up of a typical listening experiment for evaluating the sound quality of sources. Expert listeners conducted the experiment with a VR interface in two visual conditions, a congruent environment as the aarlised field, and a pitch-black environment.

The experimental design included rating tasks for the overall experience, so the effect of user experience on on those attributes could be analysed across visual conditions. A usability questionnaire was also included post-experiment, in order to make sure the interaction system and UI where usable enough so as to not nullifying the data obtained.

The results of the experiment showed the system was usable and that a congruent VR environment does not seem to have an effect, i.e. differ from the pitch-black condition, for BAQ ratings nor any of the overall experience attributes. However, it was seen in the mean ratings a tendency towards an increment of plausibility and a decrement of difficulty when congruent visual information is presented.

The experiment formed a first exploratory study in the domain but showcased major limitations: the sample size was small, the participants were cognitively overloaded, unfamiliar with VR, and the UI presented some major flaws. It can be therefore stipulated that further research with a larger sample size, larger stimuli set, and a longer training periods in VR, as well as some specific interface improvements, could bring a statistically significant differences for the attributes studied. Moreover, as the visual condition seem to not affect BAQ ratings, it is of great interesting to contemplate the possibilities of VR for perceptual assessment tasks that are impracticable or impossible in the real world. For example, a system like this could be used for instantaneously comparing the perceived BAQ for different visual layouts of a specific audio product, even without the need of creating physical prototypes, thus in a much earlier stage of design.
