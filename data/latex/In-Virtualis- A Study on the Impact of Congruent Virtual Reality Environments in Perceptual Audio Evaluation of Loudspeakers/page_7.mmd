well as symptoms and possible fatigue that may have been evoked from the VR environment. A diagram of the experiment procedure is shown in Figure 5.

## 3 Results

### _Usability_

From the observation of participants activity it could be seen how two participants accidentally skipped some of the questions in the overall experience rating task and therefore the data from these participants was not considered for the analysis. In the pre-experiment questionnaire, none of the participants reported to feel any of the common cybersickness symptoms or others. However, in the post-experiment 43% of the participants sample reported to feel too warm, 28.6% disorientation or eye strain, and 14% difficulty focusing, blurred vision or dizziness.

The results of the usability test for the different questions included were as follows:

* "The system adapts to user goals in the intended contexts of use." 44.4% of participants agreed and 33.33% disagreed, 22.2% were undecided.
* "The system syncs with the user's VAK limitations (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)." 33.3% of participants disagreed, 66.7% were undecided.
* "The system prevents users from making errors whenever possible." 22.2% of participants agreed and 55.6% disagreed, 22.2% were undecided.
* "Interface elements require no interpretation past a few seconds." 66.6% of participants agreed and 11.1% disagreed. 22.2% were undecided.
* "The user can easily find what to do next." 77.73% of participants agreed, 22.2% were undecided.

#### 3.1.1 Basic Audio Quality

In the listening test, the dependent variable was the rating values for BAQ and the independent variables the programme, acoustical, and visual condition(s). For BAQ across programmes and across sources, the parametric assumption was satisfied and a uni-variate analysis of variance was applied. The BAQ ratings were not affected by the programme [F(2,159)=0.949, p=0.389], but they were affected by the acoustical condition, i.e., the sources type, [F(2,159)=9.631, p=0.000]. For BAQ across visual conditions the parametric assumption was also satisfied and thus the Independent Samples T-Test was applied. The BAQ ratings seem to not be affected by the visual condition [t(81)=0.077, p=0.938].

In terms of the overall rating, the BAQ of Sources A,B, and C revealed the expected results. Source B, which is known to provide the most critical audio experience was rated the highest, with Source C second, and Source A, third. The average ratings for each source and visual condition can be seen in 6.

### _Overall Experience_

In the overall experience questions, the dependent variables were the perceived plausibility, task difficulty and overall QoE. The time employed in performing the test was also a dependent variable. In this case, the only
