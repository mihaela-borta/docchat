multichannel playback. The graphical presentation was designed and controlled by Unity. To allow control over the auralisation system from the virtual environment, the _Open Sound Control_ (OSC) protocol was used through a _User Datagram Protocol_ (UDP) network. The 40.4 sound system was driven by RME MADIXT at 48kHz. The system was calibrated to deliver 75dBA at the listening position. A diagram of the playback and reproduction system is shown in 4.

### Procedure

First, all assessors were introduced to the experimental design in written and verbal form and their consent to volunteer for the experiment was given. A questionnaire was also completed by all participants, reporting demographics as well as their psychological and physiological state, prior the experiment. They were then guided to the anechoic chamber, in low lighting conditions, and the experimenter ensured correct fit of the HMD and controls. To familiarise with the VR environment and the UI, a training session was conducted, where the assessors were able to interact with the interface, learn the controls and adapt in the VR space. The experimenter provided guidance if needed. No sound was provided during this phase.

After the successful completion of the training task, the assessors were able to start the main experiment. The first experimental phase included a BAQ rating paradigm. Assessors were presented with four stimuli "A-D", corresponding to the three different sources and a randomly repeated source, and their task was to score the BAQ of the stimuli ranging from bad to excellent on a numerical scale of 0-100, as recommended in [14]. The sources order of presentation was randomised, and the assessors conducted the task three times, one for each Programme. For a specific programme, the four stimuli could be played-back and the ratings modified as many times as desired, up to moving forward to the next programme. After the BAQ task, they were informed that the audio quality rating has been completed and introduced to a new UI. In this task the assessors rated three attributes including: the QoE of the presented audio visual environment, it's plausibility, and the general difficulty of the task, compared to a real experiment. The order of presentation of question, was randomised; all stimuli (3 programs \(\times\) 3 Sources) were available on screen. At the end of this phase, a break was recommended to avoid fatigue.

The second phase followed identical procedures. The main difference was the visual condition. In one condition assessors were able to see the surrounding room, and in the second, a pitch-black space was designed and only the tablet interface was presented. The order of the visual conditions was randomised. The assessors were not aware of what source were auditioning at any time of the experiment.

At the end of the main experiment, a post-experiment questionnaire was completed by the assessors. This questionnaire assessed the usability of the system, as
