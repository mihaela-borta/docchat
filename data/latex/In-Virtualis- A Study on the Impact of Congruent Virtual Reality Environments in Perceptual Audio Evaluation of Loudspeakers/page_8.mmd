independent variable was the visual condition.

As none of the data was normally distributed, and the parametric assumption was not satisfied, the Mann-Whitney test was applied for all the dependent variables. The results showed that the null hypothesis could not be rejected for any of the dependent variables, i.e. the mean ratings in both visual conditions were equal for plausibility (p=0.481), difficulty (p=0.250), QoE (p=0.898) and time (p=0.848). Nevertheless, although not statistically significant, a difference in the mean ratings across visual conditions could be seen for plausibility and difficulty attributes. The mean rating for plausibility was 59.86/100 for the Pitch-Black visual condition and 63.43/100 for the Room visual condition. For difficulty, they were 43.14 and 51.29 respectively. As the data spread varied significantly individual differences seem to have introduced noise in the data. Larger samples would be possible to allow for a clearer understanding of the results.

## 4 Discussion

First of all, the usability questionnaire results lead to think the interface allowed participants to understand what they had to do and in which order, through the whole experiment. However, it was not clear if the system was in consonance enough with the users visual, auditory and kinesthetic (VAK) limitations. As the interaction system was unprecedented, is hypothesised that this overreaching of the VAK limitations was mainly related to the kinesthetic system. The weak point of the system came unequivocally from the fact that most participants disagreed with its capability of preventing users from making error. This explains the mistakes made by two of the participants, mentioned early. Therefore, the answer to RQ5 is that an interface based on the current real-world interaction is a usable system, at least to a degree of not nullifying the data obtained with such system.

Continuing with the listening test, the results for BAQ ratings across programmes showed that there was no statistically significant difference. The difference between mean ratings across sources was also analysed and a significant effect of the source condition in the BAQ ratings was found. This was the main assumption of designing a comparison of clearly distinguishable sources and emission modes. Lastly, the results showed that there was no statistically significant difference across visual conditions. This result, although unexpected, it could be well supported by the fact that that participants were highly trained in critical tasks, and able to minimise the effect the visual environment when performing an auditory task, such as the BAQ. Therefore, the answer to RQ1 is that BAQ ratings do not differ when displaying VR visuals of the auralizated room

Moving to the overall experience attributes evaluated, the results showed that the mean ratings for Plausibility in the room condition were superior to the Pitch-Black, yet, no statistical significance was found. This may show that a tendency towards increasing plausibility due to congruent visuals is likely. However, due to the lack of significance, the answer to RQ2 is that Plausibility does not increase when displaying VR visuals of the auralizated room. For difficulty, a positive difference was seen for the room environment but with no statistical significance. Again, this may support one to argue that it was easier to take a decision on BAQ ratings when congruent visual are displayed. Regarding performance time, the mean ratings resulted equal across visual conditions. Thus, the answer to RQ3 is that neither difficulty nor efficiency differ when displaying VR visuals of the auralizated room. Lastly, the mean ratings for QoE were equal across conditions, therefore the differences observed in plausibility or difficulty do not seem to affect the degree of QoE and thus, the answer to RQ4 is that QoE does not increase when displaying VR visuals of the auralizated room

It is indispensable to take into consideration that 88.9% of the participants never tried VR before or only a few times. This affected negatively the experience with a higher introduction shock and learning curve, as all the participants reported feeling overwhelmed with the information within the VR environment and spent long time to adapt to the surroundings, i.e. seemed difficult for the participants to focus due to the cognitive load. Thus, it seems that a training session in the VR environment and interaction should have been prolonged. It fathomed that this is the main reason why no significance was obtained in the experience. Moreover, the results' reliability were probably also affected by the reduced number of subjects in the experiment.

In this paper, it was hypothesised that coherent multimodal information integration, by means of immersive virtual environments, could increase laboratory-based
