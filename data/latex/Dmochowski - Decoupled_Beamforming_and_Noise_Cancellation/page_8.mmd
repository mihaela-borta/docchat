structure being evaluated, and once again, the output signal power is recorded. The output SIR is then easily determined by combining the results of the two stages. Note that since the system is linear, the latter procedure is valid. Table II depicts the SIR improvements offered by the front-end beamformer, the decoupled BF-NC structure, and the GSC.

The sensitivity of the front-end beamformer to the location of the desired signal source is evident from Table II. In particular, when the signal source is located near the wall, the desired signal beam strongly picks up interfering signal reflections. This is evidenced from the low beamformer SIR gains experienced when the desired signal source rests near the wall. However, it is apparent that a low SIR gain at the front-end beamformer does not translate to reduced noise canceller SIR gain. The noise canceller is able to "compensate" for the lowered directivity of the beamformer. Note that the noise cancellers are adapted in the presence of reverberation, and thus, the filter taps will be driven to cancel any interference reflections in the desired signal beamformer output. Because the adaptation is carried out in the absence of the desired signal, cancellation of the desired signal due to signal reflections does not result. Even though reverberation does lead to the leakage of the desired signal into the reference noise canceller input, the filter is no longer being adapted, and thus only a distortion of the signal occurs.

Notice that there is only one location at which the GSC significantly outperforms (i.e., by \(\thicksim\)2 dB) the decoupled structure, and that this location corresponds to the smallest signal-interference separation. At this location, the signal leakage into the reference noise canceller input(s) becomes the dominant factor. The GSC's blocking matrix forms a null in the direction of the desired signal source, thus lowering the level of signal distortion. On the other hand, at all other locations, the decoupled BF-NC structure provides either superior or equivalent performance as that of the GSC. Note that the decoupled structure requires \(M-2\) less adaptive filters. The improved noise coherence between the primary and reference noise canceller inputs offered by the decoupled structure leads to this good performance despite the lowered complexity. Thus, even though the decoupled BF-NC allows more signal leakage into the reference noise canceller inputs than the GSC, the increased level of interference reduction provided by the BF-NC leads to an equivalent or superior SIR than that of the GSC.
