canceller forces a null in the direction of the interference at all frequencies. However, some signal attenuation also occurs at the lower frequencies. Nevertheless, even at these frequencies, the SIR is still high due to the depth of the interference null. From Fig. 11, the constraint forces a unity gain response of the GSC in the direction of the signal, while forming deep nulls in the direction of the interference. The price paid for this is the inclusion of \(M\boldsymbol{-}2\) additional adaptive noise cancellers.

A number of researchers have investigated beamformers from an experimental point-of-view [17, 18, 19]. The next section details an experimental evaluation of decoupled BF-NC structures.

## V Evaluation in a Real Environment

An experimental evaluation of the decoupled BF-NC defined by (14) and (15) is performed. The performance of the GSC is also evaluated for comparison purposes. The experiments are performed in a large office-room, whose layout is shown in Fig. 12. The room dimensions are 11 m by 9.5 m by 3 m. The data acquisition unit consists of a circular, sector-based, six-element microphone array with a 5 cm radius, a preamplifier, a multichannel computer sound card, and recording software. The sound sources are ordinary personal computer speakers. The sampling rate of the sound card is chosen to be 8 kHz, with a 16-bit analog-to-digital conversion. The specifications of the data acquisition unit are given in Table I.

Throughout the experiment, the sound sources and microphone array rest on a wooden table. The microphone array is not calibrated. Both desired and interfering signals are chosen to be independent realizations of a band-limited (300 Hz-3.7 kHz) white Gaussian process. The subsequent signal processing is performed offline in the MATLAB environment. In order to compute the optimal delays to perform delay-and-sum beamforming at the front-end, the generalized cross-correlation method [20] for time delay estimation with no frequency weighting is employed. A delay of \(L=100\) samples is implemented at the desired signal beamformer output for causality. The normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm with a step-size of \(\alpha=0.1\) is employed, with the adaptive filters having lengths of 200 taps. The adaptation is performed with only the interference source playing.

Throughout the evaluation, the location of the interference source is held fixed, while the desired signal source is moved around to various locations, as shown in Fig. 13. The objective of the evaluation is to determine the improvement in SIR from signal acquisition point (microphone array) to system output point for each signal-interference spatial configuration. It is important to note that since the investigation employs real (as opposed to simulated) data, the evaluation cannot be performed with desired signal and interference playing simultaneously. The experimental procedure consists of two stages. In the first stage, only the interference is captured with the array, and beamformed accordingly. The adaptive algorithm then computes the optimal transfer function between the two beamformer outputs. The captured interference is then fed back into the converged structure, and the output interference power is measured. In the second stage, the desired signal (and only the desired signal) is recorded with the array and subsequent components. The recorded signal is then applied to the converged
