away from each other. Formally, note that the level of interference reduction in the noise canceller is related to the interference-to-uncorrelated-noise ratio (IUNR) at the primary input, according to [12]. As the interference source moves away from the desired signal look direction, the level of interference at the primary noise canceller input decreases. However, the level of uncorrelated noise at the primary noise canceller input obviously does not depend on the position of the interference, and thus the IUNR decreases with increased signal-interference separation. Consequently, the SIR gain of the noise canceller decreases as the signal-interference separation increases. Notice that when taking into account the path from signal to reference noise canceller input, for small signal-interference separation (i.e., \(0^{\circ}\)-\(20^{\circ}\) ), the noise canceller suffers from a large amount of leakage of the desired signal into its reference input, according to [12]. This occurs because the steering directions of the two beamformers are similar. As a result, the desired signal is passed through the interference beam, and signal distortion occurs.

To examine the frequency-dependent nature of the SIR gains produced by the components of the decoupled BF-NC, the PSDs of the interference and signal are computed for a signal-interference separation of \(45^{\circ}\). In order to compare the performance of the decoupled BF-NC to that of a standard adaptive beamformer, the frequency-dependent SIR gain of the GSC is also computed.

Fig. 4 shows the interference power levels as a function of frequency at the front-end beamformer output, decoupled BF-NC output, and GSC output. (The signal and interference PSD at the array is 0 dB for all frequencies.) It is clear that the greatest interference cancellation is provided by the decoupled BF-NC. It is well known [15] that the level of noise reduction offered by an adaptive noise canceller is intimately related to the coherence between the primary and reference noise canceller inputs. The decoupled BF-NC minimizes the level of uncorrelated noise in the reference noise canceller input, and thus maximizes the coherence between primary and noise canceller inputs, leading to a low minimum-mean-squared-error (mmse) in the adaptation process. In the GSC, the reference beamformer is the blocking matrix, which does not provide the same level of sensor noise suppression as a DSB. Moreover, the level of interference in the blocking matrix outputs is lower than that of the reference beamformer output of the decoupled BF-NC. The coherence between primary and reference inputs in the GSC is less than in that of the decoupled structure, leading to a higher mmse. Therefore, the level of interference cancellation is not as great. The beamformer alone generally provides only moderate levels of interference reduction. Note that the dip in the front-end beamformer curve at 2600 Hz is due to a null in the beamformer's beampattern at that frequency in the direction of the interference.

Fig. 5 displays the frequency-dependent desired signal power levels. The disadvantage of the decoupled BF-NC is shown in the form of desired signal distortion at the low frequency end. This is a direct result of the desired signal being passed through the sidelobes of the interference beamformer. The blocking matrix prevents any such leakage, and, thus, the GSC preserves the desired signal power levels at the array. The stand-alone beamformer also maintains the signal power. From Figs. 4 and 5, the tradeoff between noise reduction and signal distortion is evident. The decoupled structure maximizes the noise coherence between the primary and reference noise canceller inputs; however, in order to provide this raised level of coherence, leakage of the signal into the reference noise canceller input results.

Fig. 6 displays the overall SIR gains provided by the front-end beamformer, decoupled BF-NC, and GSC. It is somewhat surprising that the decoupled BF-NC and GSC actually provide equivalent levels of SIR gain across all frequencies, especially considering the curves of Figs. 4 and 5. The manners in which the decoupled BF-NC and GSC accomplish this SIR gain are quite different, but the end result is the same. Note that the complexity of the decoupled BF-NC is significantly lower than that of the GSC. The spike in the front-end beamformer curve corresponds to a null in the beampattern in the direction of the interferer at that frequency.

The effect of including the noise canceller on the DI of the decoupled BF-NC is evaluated using (23) and (24). The parameters used are the same as those used to compute the SIR gains, with the exception that for the decoupled BF-NC, the desired
