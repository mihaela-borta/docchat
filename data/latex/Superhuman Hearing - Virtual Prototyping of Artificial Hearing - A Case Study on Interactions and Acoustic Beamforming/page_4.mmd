#### 2.2.1 Directional microphones and beamformers

To improve the SNR, estimated to be around 4-10 dB for hearing impaired [20, 61], and to help the natural directivity of the outer ear, directional microphones have been used. Such microphones have proven to increase speech intelligibility and the speech reception threshold in the range from 2 to 4 dB [69].

Spatial separation can be exploited to isolate the signal from interferences using a spatial filter at the receiver with beamforming [61]. Such algorithms may be categorized into fixed and adaptive beamforming [70]. Fixed beamformers have a fixed spatial directivity (not dependent on the acoustical environment), and focus on a desired sound source, thereby reducing the influence of background noise, more precisely to attenuate signals outside the line of sight. Examples of fixed beamforming are delay-and-sum beamforming [15, 35], weighted-sum beamforming [24], superdirective beamforming [36], and frequency-invariant beamforming [72]. In the case of adaptive beamforming, directivity is dependent on the acoustical environment. In hearing aids, the directivity is normally adaptive in order to achieve a higher noise suppression effect with coherent noise, i.e., one dominant noise source [56, 61]. The direction from which the noise arrives is continuously estimated and the beamforming directivity pattern is automatically adjusted so that the directivity notch matches the main direction of noise arrival. This process has to be free from artifacts or robust to perceivable changes in the frequency response for the frontal target direction. The adaptation process must be fast enough (\(<\) 100 milliseconds) to compensate for head movements and to track moving sources in multi source listening situations

In order to compare different beamforming solutions, the directivity Index (DI) is one of the basic performance measurements [61]. Its definition involves the power ratio of the output signal (in dB) between sound incidence from the front and the diffuse case--from sound coming equally from all directions. A correct DI is of high interest for the improvement of the effective SNR that can be achieved for frontal target sources in a diffuse noise field.

### _Virtual prototyping_

VR can be considered as an extension of 3D computer graphics with advanced input and output paradigms [34]. In a simulated environment, the user can look, move around, and experience other sensory stimuli, in a natural or artificial way [13, 55]. Computer-aided design for virtual prototyping can be applied in many different manufacturing settings from machining, assembly, inspection to more complex processes, like education [19] and training [4, 5]. Moreover, because of the ability to create the experience of being in an environment without actually be physically there, it might be used in designing rehabilitation, therapy and psychotherapy actions [16].

The use of VR technologies for prototyping implies the development of virtual experiences that should follow specific models of human-computer interaction in an attempt to formalize users' understanding and interactions within specific VEs. The conceptual VR model by Latta and Ober [42] emphasizes the user-centered approach, where the experience is analyzed from the point of view of the user's perception of digital stimuli and how the cognitive abilities/actions offered may influence the task. Moreover, considering a more holistic vision of the user experience could favor the potential user's abilities in triggering effective actions and reactions in VR [54].

In fields such as automotive, architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), VR has been rapidly adopted as part of both development and for showcase products and ideas [46]. Manufactures use VR headsets to allow engineers and designers to share iterative prototyping activities on the same model remotely and real-time without the need for sensors or special facilities. In this way, companies reduce costs, simplify collaboration within key functional areas, and showcase their results to stakeholders. The same VR approach significantly facilitates the learning process by enabling trainees to safely work with robots in VR [47]. Similarly, recent work regarding virtual prototypes for smart home systems [3] considered the interaction design (selection and control model) of virtual Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

## 3 Case study materials: virtual beamforming

The general term "directivity" is commonly used to describe the electroacoustic evaluation of directional properties. In order to investigate user interactions with this aspect in beamforming technologies, the term _directional benefit_ can be used to describe situations in which a directional model performs better than an omnidirectional model. Accordingly, research on directional hearing aids sometimes reveals little correlation between listeners' performance and directional benefit [58, 59, 60]. This is due to the mixed effect of other hearing aid properties such as signal processing algorithms, frequency shaping characteristics, technical specifications, and performance of the equipment. In contrast, it is assumed that directional benefits reflect the impact of the directivity in the microphone array on the hearing aid processing system, thus relating to the quality of the directional microphone behavior [58, 60].

While directional patterns can provide detailed information relative to directional attenuation provided by a hearing aid across angles, it is sometimes difficult to visualize the total impact of this attenuation in complex listening environments. The additional benefit directional hearing aids will provide is a key behavioral aspect of the evaluation. It can be quantified using objective measures of speech recognition as well as subjective measures of perception of sound quality, benefit, performance, and satisfaction. By far, the most common method for assessing the impact of hearing aids is the quantification of changes in speech recognition in noisy environments [61]. Accordingly, a systematic approach in such evaluation is crucial and an expendable evaluation framework is a perfect application scenario for VR prototyping.
