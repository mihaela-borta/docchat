normalized gain of direction \(0^{\circ}\) (Mdn = 13.0 dB) was significantly higher than direction \(-45^{\circ}\) (Mdn = -2.7 dB, \(p>.001\)), \(-90^{\circ}\) (Mdn = -1.9 dB, \(p>.001\)), \(-135^{\circ}\) (Mdn = -2 dB, \(p>.001\)), \(180^{\circ}\) (-2.7 dB, \(p>.001\)), \(135^{\circ}\) (Mdn = -1 dB, \(p=.004\)), and \(45^{\circ}\) (Mdn = -1.3 dB, \(p=.001\)). No significant difference between directions \(0^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\) (Mdn = -1.2 dB) was found, and none of the other sources differed significantly from each other.

### Parlag task performances

Fig. (a)a shows the results pertaining to the number of _correct pairings_ during exposure to abstract and realistic visuals. In regard to abstract visuals, the Friedman test found no significant difference between conditions, \(X^{2}(2)=1.687,p=.430\). Similarly, the Friedman test used to compare the data from the realistic scenario found no significant difference between conditions (\(X^{2}(2)=1.226,p=.542\)). As apparent, the number of correct pairings was higher when the participants were exposed to realistic visuals across all three conditions. However, the Mann-Whitney U tests only indicated that the median difference was significant when comparing HE across the study realistic visuals (Mdn = 3.0) and the study involving abstract visuals (Mdn = 2.0), \(U=146,z=.2309,p=.021\).

In Fig. 8 (top), average pairing time in sequential pairing reveals that the _first pairing_ can be clearly distinguished from the subsequent activities. Participants efforts were mainly involved in this first period, which heavily contributes to timing performances in both scenarios. Fig. (c)c shows the results pertaining to the first pairing time during exposure to abstract visuals and realistic visuals. The Friedman test revealed no significant difference in pairing time between conditions in the abstract visual scenario, \(X^{2}(2)=1.000,p=.607\). However, a Friedman test indicated that interactions in realistic condition differed significantly in terms of pairing time, \(X^{2}(2)=8.769,p=.012\), and the pairwise comparisons indicated that median pairing time for HC (Mdn = 160.8) was significantly lower than the median pairing time of HE (Mdn = 1444.2), \(p=.010\). Moreover, the performed Mann-Whitney U tests indicated that pairing times with HC were significantly higher during exposure to abstract visuals (Mdm=160.9), \(U=47.0,z=-2.135,p=.033\). No significant differences between studies were found with respect to H and HE.

The action of pairing two speakers did not differ in the sequential pairing order due to short action time and high variability among participants. Fig. (bottom)b displays median values. For this reason, the _pairing action time_ was computed without considering pairing order and Fig. (b)b shows the results during exposure to abstract visuals (\(n=14\)) and realistic visuals (\(n=13\)). In regard to the abstract visual scenario, the Friedman test revealed no significant effect of interaction technique on pairing action time, \(X^{2}(2)=1.857,p=.395\). Moreover, the Friedman test used to compare the results pertaining to the realistic scenario, found no significant difference between conditions, \(X^{2}(2)=4.154,p=.125\). The Mann-Whitney U tests found no significant difference between HC combined with abstract visuals (Mdn = 5.0) and HC combined with realistic visuals (Mdn = 1.7), \(U=63.0,z=-1.359,p=.185\). However, with respect to H, the medians pairing action time was significantly higher during exposure to abstract visuals (Mdn = 4.2) compared to realistic visuals (Mdn = 2.4), \(U=48.0,z=-2.087,p=.308\). Similarly, with respect to HE, the median pairing action time was significantly higher during exposure to abstract visuals (Mdn = 7.0) compared to realistic visuals (Mdn = 2.6), \(U=42.0,z=-2.378,p=.017\).

### Questionnaires

Fig. (d)d shows the results of the NASA RTIX related to the study involving abstract visuals (\(n=18\)) and realistic visuals (\(n=17\)). A Friedman test indicated that participants answers with abstract visuals were statistically significantly different between conditions, \(X^{2}(2)=8.842,p=.012\), and pairwise comparisons using Dunn-Bonferroni identified a significant difference between HC (Mdn = 3.00) and H (Mdn = 3.25), \(p=.037\), indicating that the perceived task load was slightly higher when the participants relied on head-based only interaction. However, these results were only marginally significant when the same analysis was performed on the reduced sample (n=14), \(X^{2}(2)=5.915,p=.052\). The questionnaire data related to the realistic scenario were normally distributed, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk test (\(p>.05\)), no significant outliers were identified, and Mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity was met, \(X^{2}(2)=1.089,p=.580\). However, the one-way repeated measures ANOVA found no significant difference in RTIX scores between conditions, \(F(2,32)=1.123,p=.338\). Moreover, the three Mann-Whitney U tests did not reveal any significant differences in regard aggregate RTIX scores.

Fig. (a)a shows the results related to aggregate UX scores obtained from the UEQ-S administered after exposure to realistic visuals. The data were normally distributed, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk's test (\(p>.05\)), no significant outliers were identified, and Mauchly's test indicated that the assumption of sphericity was met, \(X^{2}(2)=2.739,p=.254\). However, a one-way repeated measures
