The gain of the beamformer (with the interference) on the interfering source is given by \({\bf w}^{H}{\bf h}_{i}\). Using the definition of the weights,

\[{\bf w}^{H}{\bf h}_{i} = {\bf h}_{0}^{H}{\bf R}^{-1}{\bf h}_{i} \tag{23}\] \[= {\bf h}_{0}{\bf Q}^{-1}{\bf h}_{i}-\frac{A_{i}^{2}\left[{\bf h}_{0} ^{H}{\bf Q}^{-1}{\bf h}_{i}\right]\left[{\bf h}_{i}^{H}{\bf Q}^{-1}{\bf h}_{i} \right]}{1+A_{i}^{2}{\bf h}_{i}^{H}{\bf Q}^{-1}{\bf h}_{i}}\] \[= \frac{{\bf h}_{0}^{H}{\bf Q}^{-1}{\bf h}_{i}}{1+A_{i}^{2}{\bf h}_ {i}^{H}{\bf Q}^{-1}{\bf h}_{i}}\]

The numerator in the final equation is the response of the optimal beamformer on the interference _if the interferer were not present_. The denominator represents the amount by which this response is reduced due to the presence of the interferer. Note that the amount by which the gain is reduced is dependent on the power of the interference (corresponding to \(A_{i}^{2}\)). The stronger the interference source, the greater is it suppressed. An optimal beamformer may "ignore" a weak interfering source.

Figure 2 illustrates the performance of the optimal beamformer. This example uses line of sight conditions, which allows us to use "beampatterns". However, it must be emphasized that this is for convenience only. In line of sight conditions, the direction of arrival, \(\phi\), determines the spatial signature to be the steering vector, \({\bf s}(\phi)\), as developed earlier in this course. In the first case, there are two interferers at angles \(\phi=30^{o}\), \(150^{o}\) and in the other, there two interferers at \(\phi=40^{o}\), \(150^{o}\). The desired signal is at \(\phi=0\). Note how the null moves over from \(30^{o}\) to \(40^{o}\). It is important to realize that the optimal beamformer creates these nulls (suppresses the interfering sources) _without a-priori knowledge as to the location of the interference sources_.

If there are more interfering sources than elements, all sources cannot be nulled (a \(N\) element array can only null \(N-1\) interfering signals). In this case, the beamformer sets the weights to minimize the _overall_ output interference power. Figure 3 illustrates this situation. The solid line is the case of seven equally strong interfering sources received by a five element antenna array (\(N=5\)). Note that the array, apparently, forms only four nulls. These nulls do not correspond directly to the locations of the interference as it is the _overall_ interference that is being minimized. The dashed line plots the beampattern in the case that one of the seven interfering sources, arriving from \(\phi=40^{o}\), is extremely strong. Note that the beamformer automatically moves a null in direction of this strong interferer (to the detriment of the suppression of the other interfering sources - again, it is the _overall_ interference power that is minimized).

### Relation of Beampattern and Noise

In this section we focus on the impact the weights have on the noise component. Again, the term "beampattern" has a connotation that beamforming is for line of sight conditions only. In point of fact, a beampattern can always be defined. However, in multipath fading channels, the desired
