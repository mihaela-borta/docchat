\[y(n)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^{M}c(k)x(n-k)+\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N}b(k)y(n-k). \tag{7}\]

1.Aleatory generation of the initial chromosome population.

\[S_{i}=\begin{bmatrix}c_{i}(0),...,c_{i}(M),b_{i}(0),...,b_{i}(N)\end{bmatrix} 1\leq i\leq S\,. \tag{8}\]

2.Selection of chromosomes: to evaluate the mean quadratic error from each P group chromosome and to select the most optimal one.

\[J_{Sii,S2j,...Spt}(n)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{P-1}e_{i}^{2}(n)\quad 1\leq i,j,...,t\leq S\,. \tag{9}\]

3.The coefficients obtained should be used on the adaptive algorithm based on the steepest gradient method.

## 4 Conclusions

The recurrent neural networks along with DSP implementation provide effective method for controlling acoustic noise under the presence of unknown nonlinear phenomena. There is no systematic way of selecting suitable network topology for a particular ANC problem. However, it is advisable to start with small enough hidden neurons in both Model and Control Neural Networks, then try to increase the number of neurons until no further improvement occurred in the resulting noise attenuation level.
