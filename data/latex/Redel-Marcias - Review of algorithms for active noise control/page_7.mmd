control/filtering problem (Kuo and Morgan, 1996; Bambang, 2000). Fuzzy logic and neural networks could be non-linear controller and suitable for modeling and control of non-linear system (Baruch et al, 2001).

Genetic algorithms present two problems: a slow convergence velocity and higher cost of computing. The number of operation that this algorithms need depends on the number of filter coefficients and the number of chromosome from each generation.

### Adaptive genetic IIR filtering

\[y(n)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^{M}c(k)x(n-k)+\sum\limits_{k=l}^{N}b(k)y(n-k). \tag{4}\]

1.Aleatory generation of the initial chromosome population.

\[S_{i}=\left[c_{i}(0),...,c_{i}(M),b_{i}(0),...,b_{i}(N)\right]\quad 1\leq i \leq S. \tag{5}\]

2.Selection of chromosomes: to evaluate the mean quadratic error from each chromosome and to select the most optimal one.

\[\sigma_{i}^{2}=\frac{1}{L}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{L}e_{i}^{2}(n). \tag{6}\]

3.The coefficients obtained should be used on the adaptive algorithm based on the steepest gradient method.

In the process of daughter chromosome generation, the stability of the IIR filter should be checked for each chromosome. This verification consists of to convert the IIR filter coefficients b(k) in the reflection of a equivalent structure (Oppenheimand Schafer, 1971). IIR filter is stable if the absolute value of the reflection coefficients is lower than one. If some coefficient is larger than this limit, it will be equal to one.

### Adaptive genetic multi channel algorithm

Design of adaptive algorithm of control multi-channel system with P output and P error input, see Figure 3, can be executed by genetic algorithms (Tang et al, 1995). The main advantage of those algorithms is that the electro-acoustic transfer functions PxP are not necessary to estimate them between each input and error signal. Other characteristic is that the output signal is generated by only a FIR/IR filter. This way, the architecture of the controller is simplified.
