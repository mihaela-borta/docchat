general, ANC has proven a viable method for noise suppression in low frequency ranges where traditional passive noise control devices become massive, bulky, or less effective.

In active sound control there are three basic components: the error sensors, the signal processing equipment and the actuators. The error sensors detect the sound field and pass the information to the processing equipment. Commonly, a digital signal processor is employed to analyze the sound field and determine how to drive the actuators to control the sound. The processing determines the ideal amplitude and phase for driving the actuators to cancel the sound in a given situation. To generate the anti noise, two main configurations of ANC systems are often used, feedforward and feedback control, which using adaptive filters (Elliot and Nelson, 1993; Kuo and Morgan, 1999). Both feedforward and feedback configurations, as well as adaptive filters and their new implementations by genetic algorithm will be evaluated in this work.

## 2 ANC systems

Modern active sound control systems consist of one or more control sources used to introduce a secondary (or controlling) disturbance into the structural/acoustic system. This disturbance suppresses the unwanted noise originating from one or more primary sources. The control signals that drive the control actuators are generated by an electronic controller, which uses as inputs, measurements of the residual field (remaining after introduction of the control disturbance) and in the case of feedforward adaptive systems, a measure of the incoming primary disturbance.

An important property of many modern active sound control systems (particularly feedforward systems) is that they are self-tuning (adaptive) so that they can adapt to small changes in the system being controlled. Changes only need to be small changes to cause a non-adaptive feedforward control system to become ineffective. Non-adaptive controllers are generally confined to the feedback type in cases where slight changes in the environmental conditions will not be reflected in significant degradation in controller performance. An interesting aside is that an adaptive feedforward controller is effectively a closed loop implementation of a non-adaptive feedforward controller.

One of the problems concerned with ANC is the existence of acoustical feedback between the control value and the reference signal. In this way, Bismor (Bismor, 2008) present new method, namely, virtual unidirectional sound source to acoustic feedback cancellation.

Other work using genetic algorithm to optimize ANC system or using recurrent neural networks for nonlinear ANC can be found in (Jinn-Tsong et al, 2009; Chen et al, 2008).

A new frame of future works could be established by use of controller PID to ANC and genetic algorithms to determine the constants of the PID in industrial machines.

### Feedforward ANC system

Depending on kind of noise in the environment, broadband and narrowband, the configuration of the feedforward ANC system will be different. Broadband feedforward ANC is exemplified by the control of an acoustic noise in long, narrow ducts, such as exhaust pipes and ventilation systems. By contrast, narrowband ANC is related to noise caused by rotating, repetitive machines or nearly periodic. The general implementation of this system is shown in the Figure 1a. First a reference sensor is used to get a reference signal and second an error sensor is utilized to update the adaptive filter by measuring the residual of the anti noise and primary noise. This system was proposed by Paul Lueg to cancel the noise in ducts.
