beams and sidelobe lobe suppression. The proposed algorithm maintains a similar output SINR as that of the SCB-dual beam. Moreover, there is not much difference in the output SINR obtained for the SCB-one beam and the proposed algorithm.

## 6 Conclusion

A novel algorithm for SLL reduction in the presence of dual desired signals is developed. The conventional SCB is modified for dual desired signals and limited additional constraints are introduced to control the SLL. In this manner, the algorithm becomes less vulnerable to unexpected interferences while also producing dual beams in the two desired directions. The results obtained from the proposed algorithm indicate that it is able to accomplish its goals, even when the desired signals are close to each other. Additionally, the algorithm maintains the output SINR and produces insignificant deviation between the main lobes directions and the DOAs of SOIs. Further, this work can be extended for multiple desired signals and the DOA mismatch environment.
