interference to noise ratio (INR) of 15 dB and 20 dB for this scenario. The angles in the range (\(\theta_{i}-8^{\circ}\), \(\theta_{i}+8^{\circ}\)) are excluded because it becomes difficult for the proposed algorithm to effectively suppress the interference signal that lies in the main lobe region.

#### 5.1.1 Radiation pattern comparison

The radiation patterns are obtained for DOAs of SOIs in the range [ - 60\({}^{\circ}\), 60\({}^{\circ}\)] with the step size of 1\({}^{\circ}\). But it is not feasible to show all the obtained radiation patterns for the considered range. Therefore, three different angles are chosen that lies in the extreme left, extreme right, and in the middle of the considered range. The radiation pattern comparison for dual beam SCB and the proposed algorithm for three different angles is depicted in Fig. 2. From the illustrated radiation patterns, it can be observed that the SCB-dual beam has higher sidelobes and they are more dominant near the main beams. This can cause performance degradation in case of unexpected interferences. The displayed radiation patterns also show that the proposed algorithm reduces the SLL not only in the ROIs but also in the entire considered range of angles. Moreover, the main beams are directed towards the DOAs of SOIs.

#### 5.1.2 Characteristic parameters

As it is not possible to display all of the obtained radiation patterns for the range under consideration. So, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by calculating the important characteristics of the radiation pattern that are relative SLL, maximum SLL, 3-dB beamwidth, BWTM, and the deviation in the main lobe direction from the respective DOA of SOI.

The comparison of characteristic parameters obtained from the SCB dual beam and the proposed algorithm is shown in Fig. 2(a). From the first and second graphs of Fig. 2(a), it is clear that the proposed algorithm achieves the SLL reduction in the ROI for each angle of SOIs. This sidelobe level is calculated in the ROI i.e., around the main beams. The proposed algorithm achieves maximum and minimum improvement of approximately 20 dB and 2 dB respectively, in relative SLL as compared to SCB dual beam beamformer. The deviations in the directions of main lobes w.r.t with their actual DOAs are evaluated. The percentage deviation is calculated by taking the SCB dual beam as a reference. It can be seen from the third and fourth graphs of Fig. 2(a) that the proposed algorithm produces insignificant deviations in both the main lobes.

The BWFM and 3-dB beamwidth (BW) of the two main beams are also evaluated and depicted in Fig. 2(b), respectively. It can be seen from the figure that a little broadening of the main lobes is observed which can be considered as a side effect of sidelobes suppression. The BWFM of main beams is broadened by approximately 4\({}^{\circ}\) whereas 3-dB BW is only increased by 1.5\({}^{\circ}\). This side effect is expected as reducing the power of sidelobes may cause accumulation of power towards the main lobes.

Now, the maximum level of sidelobes in the ROIs and non-ROIs for
