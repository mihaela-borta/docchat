each considered angle of SOI is also calculated which is shown in Fig. 4. From where it is clear that the proposed algorithm improves the maximum sidelobe level even for the non-interested region. The maximum improvement of approximately 4 dB is achieved as compared to the SCB dual beam beamformer.

To have a more clear observation, the mean values of the characteristic parameters are calculated for the entire considered range of SOIs. From Table 1, it can be seen that there is an improvement of approximately 8 dB in the SLL of the interested region by applying the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the maximum SLL is also improved by 1.4 dB as compared to the SCB-dual beam. But this improvement is achieved at the cost of an increase in 3-dB BW and BWFM by approximately 1.1\({}^{\circ}\) and 4\({}^{\circ}\), respectively. The average deviations of the actual main beams directions from the respective desired directions and nulls directions from the interference directions are also calculated and the proposed algorithm shows negligible deviations in the main beams, nulls and the results of all methods are almost identical. The pictorial comparison of the parameters for the considered algorithms is depicted in Fig. 5.

### Asymmetric SOIs

For the asymmetric case the DOA of the first SOI is kept fixed at \(\theta_{\mathrm{e}_{1}}=0^{o}\) and the DOA of the second SOI is varied in the range of [40\({}^{\circ}\), 60\({}^{\circ}\)] with the step size of 1\({}^{\circ}\). The other parameters are kept the same as that of the symmetric case.

#### 5.2.1 Radiation pattern comparison

The proposed algorithm is executed for \(\theta_{\mathrm{e}_{1}}=0^{o}\) and \(\theta_{\mathrm{e}_{2}}\) is varied in the range [40\({}^{\circ}\), 60\({}^{\circ}\)] with the step size of 1\({}^{\circ}\). It is not possible to show all of the radiation patterns that have been obtained in the range under consideration. So, three different angles of SOIs are chosen from the range and the radiations patterns for these three distinct angles are shown in Fig. 6. From where it can be seen that the sidelobes are greatly suppressed in the ROIs along with dual beams toward the desired directions after the application of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm preserves lower or identical sidelobes in the non-interested region as SCB dual beam.

#### 5.2.2 Characteristic parameters of asymmetric case

The radiation patterns are evaluated for every angle of the considered range [40\({}^{\circ}\), 60\({}^{\circ}\)] with a step size of 1\({}^{\circ}\) and from the obtained radiation patterns important characteristics are determined. The relative SLL of dual beams is depicted in the first and second graphs of Fig. 6(a). The sidelobe levels around the main beams are significantly minimized and maintained below \(-\)16dB for the entire range. The maximum improvement of approximately 16 dB is obtained in SLL by applying the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the level of sidelobes in the non-interested region is also evaluated and depicted in the third graph of Fig. 6(a). It is clear from the third graph that maximum SLL is also controlled in the non-interested region as the level of the proposed algorithm is below the SCB dual beam beamformer for the entire range of angles. The deviation in the main beam direction w.r.t. its DOA is calculated and displayed in the fourth graph of Fig. 6(a). From where it can be said that stable main beams are directed towards the desired directions because the deviation in the main beams is less than 0.6% which can be considered as negligible. The beamwidths of the two main beams are calculated and shown in Fig. 6(b). BWFM of the dual beams is illustrated in the first and second graphs of the Fig. 6(b), from where it can be noticed that BWFM of the proposed algorithm is increased as compared to SCB dual beam which leads to little widening of main beams. The 3-dB BW is also increased by approximately 1\({}^{\circ}\) which can be observed from the third and fourth graphs of Fig. 6(b). This little widening of main beams can be considered as a disadvantage of the proposed
