the visual system, people can resolve subtle temporal dynamics in sounds more readily than in visual stimuli; thus the rendering of data into sound may manifest periodic or other temporal information that is not easily perceivable in visualizations [17]. Moreover, the ears are capable of decomposing complex auditory scenes [3] and selectively attending to certain sources, as seen, for example, in the cocktail party problem [7]. Audition, then, may be the most appropriate modality for simple and intuitive (see [9, 37]) information display when data have complex patterns, express meaningful changes in time, or require immediate action.

In this chapter, an overview is presented of how knowledge of human perception and cognition can be helpful in the design of multimodal systems where interactive sonic feedback plays an important role. Table 10.1 presents a typology of different kinds of cross- modal interactions, adapted from [2].

Sonic feedback can interact with visual or haptic feedback in different ways. As an example, cross-modal mapping represents the situation where one or more dimensions of a sound are mapped to visual or haptic feedback: A beeping sound combined with a flashing light. In cross-modal mapping, there is no specific interaction between the two modalities, but simply a function that connects some parameters of one modality to the parameters of another.
