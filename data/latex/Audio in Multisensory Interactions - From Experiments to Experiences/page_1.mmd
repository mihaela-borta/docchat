###### Abstract

In the real and virtual world, we usually experience sounds in combination with at least an additional modality, such as vision, touch or proprioception. Understanding how sound enhances, substitutes or modifies the way we perceive and interact with the world is an important element when designing interactive multimodal experiences. In this chapter, we present an overview of sound in a multimodal context, ranging from basic experiments in multimodal perception to more advanced interactive experiences in virtual reality.

## 10.1 Introduction

This book examines the role of sound in virtual environments (VEs). However, most of our interactions with both the physical and virtual worlds appear through a combination of different sensory modalities. Auditory feedback is often the consequence of an action produced by touch and is presented in the form of a combination of auditory, haptic and visual feedback. Let us consider for example the simple action of walking: The auditory feedback is given by the sound produced by the shoes interacting with the floor, the visual feedback is the surrounding environment, and the haptic feedback is the feeling of the surface one is stepping on. It is important that these different sensory modalities are perceived in synchronization, in order to experience a coherent action.

Since sound can be perceived from all directions, it is ideal for providing information when the eyes are otherwise occupied. This could be a situation where someone's visual attention should be entirely devoted to a specific task such as driving or a surgeon operating on a patient [46]. Another notable property of the human auditory system is its sensitivity to the temporal aspects of sound [3]. In many instances, response times for auditory stimuli are faster than those for visual stimuli [55]. Furthermore, given the higher temporal resolution of the auditory system compared to
