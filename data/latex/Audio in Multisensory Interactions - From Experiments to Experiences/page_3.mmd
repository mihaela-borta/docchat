Intersensory biases become important where audition and a second modality provide conflicting cues. In the following section, several examples of intersensory biases will be provided. In most of these situations, the user tries to perceptually integrate the conflicting information. This conflict might lead to a bias towards a stronger modality. One classic example is the ventriloquism effect [24], which illustrates the dominance of visual over auditory information when spatially discrepant audio and visual cues are experienced as co-localized at the location of the visual cue.

The name clearly derives from the ventriloquists, who are able to give the impression that the speaking voice is originated from the dummy they are holding, as opposed as from the person herself. This effect is commonly used in cinemas and home theatres where, although the sound physically originates at the speakers, it appears as if coming from the moving images on screen. The ventriloquist effect occurs because the visual estimates of location are typically more accurate than the auditory estimates of location, and therefore the overall perception of location is largely determined by vision. This phenomenon is also known as visual capture [64]. Another classic example is the Colavita effect [8]. In the original experiment, Colavita presented participants with an auditory (tone) or visual (light) stimulus, to which they were instructed to respond by pressing the tone key or light key respectively. When presented with bimodal stimuli, the visual dominance effect refers to the phenomenon where participants respond more often to the visual component.

Vision is indeed the dominant sense in many circumstances. On one hand, visual dominance over hearing and other sensory modalities has been frequently demonstrated (e.g., [45]), and a neural basis has been posited for visual dominance in processing audiovisual objects (e.g., [48]). Cross-modal enhancement refers to stimuli from one sensory channel enhancing or altering the perceptual interpretation of stimuli from another sensory channel. As an example, three studies presented in [57] show how high-quality auditory displays coupled with high-quality visual displays increase the quality perception of the visual displays relative to the evaluation of the visual display alone. Moreover, the same study shows how low-quality auditory displays coupled with high-quality visual displays decrease the perception of quality of the auditory displays relative to the evaluation of the auditory display alone. These studies were performed by manipulating the pixel resolution of the visual display and Gaussian white noise level, and by manipulating the sampling frequency of the auditory display and Gaussian white noise level. These findings strongly suggest that the quality of realism in an audiovisual display must be a function of both auditory and visual display fidelities and their interactions. Cross-modal enhancements can occur even when extra-modal input does not provide information directly meaningful for the task. An early study by Stein asked subjects to rate the intensity of a beam of light. Their findings showed that the test subjects believed the light to be brighter when it was accompanied by a brief, broadband auditory stimulus than when it was presented alone. The auditory stimulus produced more enhancement for lower visual intensities, regardless of the relative location of the auditory cue source.

Cross-modal transfers or illusions are situations where stimulation in one sensory channel leads to the illusion of stimulation in another sensory channel. An example of
