* 128 Figure 2 shows the visual appearances of the three rooms. Figure 2A shows the anechoic room with foam wedges as commonly seen in anechoic chambers. For the acoustic reproduction of this room only the direct sound was reproduced from single loudspeakers. In Figure 2B the mid-reverberant room can be seen. The visual as well as the acoustical properties were similar to a large living room. The highly reverberant room is shown in Figure 2C. It was modelled with bare concrete surfaces to simulate a highly reverberant, yet realistic environment.
* 129 The rooms were simulated using the room acoustic simulation software Odeon (Odeon A/S, Kgs. Lyngby, Denmark) with the materials and surface absorption coefficients as shown in Table 1. For the anechoic room, only the direct sound was considered. In Figure 3 the reverberation time, clarity and direct-to-reverberant ratio of the three rooms are shown. The reverberation time as well as the clarity were calculated using the ITA-toolbox (Berzborn et al., 2017), the direct-to-reverberant ratio was calculated as the ratio between the direct sound and the reflections. Mind that for the anechoic condition the clarity and direct-to-reverberant ratio are infinite as no reflections are present which is indicated with arrows.

Figure 2: Visual appearance of the three virtual rooms. A: anechoic, B: mid-reverberant, C: high-reverberant. The dimensions in the rooms are identical, while the surface materials differ.
