* [296] IV. Discussion
* [297] In the current study we investigated the ability of normal-hearing listeners to identify and locate a story in the presence of other stories. The task of the listeners was to locate a target story in the presence of a varying number of simultaneous interfering talkers. Furthermore, the effect of audio-visual room information was investigated, by testing different audio-visually coherent and incoherent reverberant environments. The data showed that the localization accuracy and the response time are affected by the number of simultaneous talkers as well as by reverberation. With an increase of number of interfering talkers and an increase of reverberation time the performance of the listeners decreased. Presenting incoherent audio-visual room information did not affect the outcome measures.
* [307] A. Effect of number of talkers
* [308] Several factors are likely to affect the increase in response time with increasing number of talkers.
* [309] In the present study the speech level of each talker was kept constant independent of the number of talkers, and therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases. Thus, the intelligibility is expected to drop with the number of simultaneous talkers. However, the effective SNR is constantly changing with head-motion and fluctuations in the signals [16]. The head-motion introduces a variation of the target and interferer angles relative to the head and thus head-shadow and interaural time differences vary. Both head-shadow and interaural time differences have been shown to be utilized to separate target and interfering speech sources [100, 101]. Fluctuations in the speech signals allow for dip-listening which can significantly improve the SNR in some time-frequency bins. Such glimpses can help to better understand speech [101, 102]. When many speech sources are presented, such glimpses are usually reduced [100, 103].
