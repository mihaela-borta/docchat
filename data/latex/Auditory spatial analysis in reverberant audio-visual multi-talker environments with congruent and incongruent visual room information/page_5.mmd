* [87] Most of the beforementioned studies focused on the ability to localize speech but less to comprehend the speech. However, in a real-world cocktail party, listeners need to perform both tasks to successfully communicate. In the current study, we asked listeners to locate a talker speaking about a certain topic, while presenting a varying number of other simultaneous talkers. Thus, the primary task was to understand the speech and the secondary task to locate the talker. The experiment was conducted in an audio-visual virtual environment using a loudspeaker array and virtual reality glasses. The listeners' task was to indicate a semi-transparent avatar at the location of an acoustic source talking about a topic indicated by an icon. The sources were located at one of fifteen possible locations with 15\({}^{\circ}\) horizontal separation. The number of simultaneous speech sources was varied between two and eight. Three virtual rooms were simulated visually and acoustically. Furthermore, a condition with incongruent audio-visual cues was presented by visually showing the anechoic room and acoustically presenting the reverberant room or vice versa.

* [90] Thirteen Danish native speaking normal-hearing listeners aged 20-26 years participated in the experiment (7 female and 6 male). Participants were paid on an hourly basis and gave consent to an ethics agreement approved by the Science-Ethics Committee for the Capital Region of Denmark (reference H-16036391).
