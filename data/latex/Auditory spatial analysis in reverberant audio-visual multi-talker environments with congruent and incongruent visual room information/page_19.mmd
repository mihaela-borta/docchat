* 344 reverberant conditions and anechoic conditions were found (Ahrens, Marschall, et al., 2019; Duquesnoy & Plomp, 1980; Plomp, 1976). The reason for this discrepancy could be that the test paradigm might not be as sensitive to capture small differences in reverberation time, as traditional speech tests. However, (Kopco et al., 2010) discussed a similar finding that mild reverberation does not affect the speech localization in background speech by comparing their study with data from (B. D. Simpson et al., 2006). This raises the question if there is an effect of mild reverberation on speech intelligibility in everyday situations or if this effect can only be observed in artificial listening scenarios in the laboratory.

* 354 The spatial scene analysis method employed in this study was similar to (Weller et al., 2016). The most significant difference between the approaches is that in the current study the target speech stimulus needed to be understood while the task in (Weller et al., 2016) was to judge the gender of all talkers presented in a scene. Consequently, they used the total number of perceived talkers as their main outcome measure, while we used the response time. Furthermore, in their study the participants needed to translate the spatial percept from an egocentric auditory perception onto a top-down view interface. This translation was not needed in the current study as virtual reality was employed as a user interface.
* 362 While the use of virtual reality can allow for a more user-friendly interface, virtual reality could also introduce issues to an experiment. For example, the auditory percept might be affected by the physical presence of the headset which has been shown to be negligible for setups with far spaced sources (Ahrens, Lund, et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2018). Furthermore, virtual reality glasses might alter the participant's behavior due to their physical appearance but also because the visual world
