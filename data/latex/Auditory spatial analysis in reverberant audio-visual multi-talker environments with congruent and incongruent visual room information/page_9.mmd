* 164 semi-transparent humanoid shapes independent of the actual number of concurrent talkers. Figure 165 1 visualizes the possible talker locations between -105\({}^{\circ}\) to 105\({}^{\circ}\) separated by 15\({}^{\circ}\) in the frontal hemisphere at a distance of 2.4 m. The task was performed by pointing at the position where the target talker was perceived. The participants were using a virtual reality controller that included the visual appearance of a laser pointer in the virtual room.
* 169 For each scene a unique talker, story and position was randomly chosen as the target. Between one and seven masking talkers were included in a similar way. No talker, story or position could occur twice at the same time. For each trial, the acoustic talkers were presented for 120 seconds. The stories were started at a random point in time and were repeated from the beginning after finishing.
* 173 Thus, no bias towards the beginning of each story was introduced. The listener could indicate the perceived target talker position at any time, even after the audio had stopped. Each individual talker was presented at a sound pressure level of 55 dB SPL.
* 176 Three congruent audio-visual rooms were used as described above, an anechoic, a mid-reverberant and a high-reverberant room. In addition to the conditions with congruent audio and visual room information, two conditions with incongruent audio-visual cues were considered. These were anechoic acoustics with the appearance of a highly reverberant room and high-reverberant acoustics with the visuals of the anechoic room. Thus, five room conditions were tested. Each of the conditions was repeated three times resulting in 105 trials, five audio-visual conditions and between two and eight concurrent talkers.
* 183 Prior to the experiment, the listeners performed a familiarization phase, where they were familiarized with the speech material and the story content but not with the task itself. The anechoic version of the ten stories were played back via headphones in a randomized order. Each talker was randomly assigned to one of the stories. Thus, listeners heard each story and each talker once. For
