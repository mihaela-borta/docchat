* [271] Figure 7: The percentage of correct response locations comparing the coherent and incoherent audio-visual conditions. Each bar contains 42 datapoints across subjects and repetitions. The three colors indicate the room conditions.
* [272] Figure 8 shows the response times for the incongruent audio-visual conditions (grey boxes), i.e., the conditions with anechoic acoustic stimuli and the visuals of the reverberant room (light grey) and with high acoustic reverberation and the visuals of the anechoic room (dark grey). Additionally, the response times from the coherent anechoic and reverberant conditions are shown (blue boxes, as in Figure 5). No significant difference was found between the congruent and the incongruent condition [p\(>\)0.12].
