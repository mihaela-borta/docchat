* 64 improve speech perception (Arweiler et al., 2013; Arweiler & Buchholz, 2011; Warzybok et al., 2013).
* 66 Previous studies have investigated the ability of listeners to identify and locate speech in the presence of other speech sources. (Kopco et al., 2010) measured the localization accuracy of a digit spoken by a female talker in the presence of words spoken by male interfering talkers. The target and the interferers were all presented in the frontal area of the listener. They found that the presence of the interferers reduced the localization accuracy. (Buchholz & Best, 2020) measured localization accuracy with a similar target digit as in (Kopco et al., 2010) but with a more realistic background noise scene. The interfering signals were seven paired conversations (both male and female) at various locations in a simulated cafeteria. Results showed that the localization accuracy was only affected by the noise when the target source was distant but not when it was nearby. This finding suggests an interaction with reverberation, as farther sources have more reverberant energy relative to the direct sound compared to nearby sources.
* 67 While these studies focused on the ability to locate a speech signal in a speech background, (Hawley et al., 1999) investigated both the localization accuracy of speech as well as the intelligibility. They showed that the inability to correctly locate a source did not limit the ability to correctly understand it. However, the number of interfering sources was limited to three.
* 68 (Weller et al., 2016) presented a novel method to evaluate the ability to analyze a complex acoustic scene. They asked their listeners to judge the location of all talkers presented in a virtual cocktail-party situation by indicating the gender of the talkers. When varying the number of simultaneously presented talkers, they found that normal-hearing listeners were able to correctly locate and count the number of talkers for up to four sources. When six talkers were presented, the accuracy decreased.
