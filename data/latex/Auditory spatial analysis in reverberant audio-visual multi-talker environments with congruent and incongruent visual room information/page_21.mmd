* 391 to understand than others. However, as stories and talkers were chosen randomly, their influence is likely to be little over the sufficiently large number of iterations.
* 393 One aim of this study was to develop a test paradigm that is more like real-life listening than most current speech intelligibility tests. While the task of understanding and locating a speech stream out of interfering speech is more similar to traditional speech tests, it is by no means a replications of a realistic cocktail-party situation. Firstly, all talkers are located at the same distance and with the same speech level and face the listener. This decision was made to not give any level, directional or direct-to-reverberant energy cues other than the information from the room reflections and the talkers themselves. Secondly, the visual avatars are highly conceptualized human bodies. Technology does not yet allow to visualize highly realistic human avatars with conventional computational power and effort. When using avatars that share similarities with real humans but evidently are not, viewers might get distracted (compare uncanny valley, (Diel et al., 2022)). Thirdly, lip-movements have not been included in this study. This choice was made because lip-movement simulations are not, as to the knowledge of the authors, evaluated for hearing research purposes. Additionally, the aim of the avatars was more to be a'response-box' than an actual simulation of a human talker.

* 396 In the present study we investigated the ability of listeners to analyze a spatial scene with multiple talkers. A varying number of simultaneously spoken stories was presented in different reverberant environments and listeners were asked to locate a target story. Results showed that the number of simultaneous talkers affected the correct identification as well as the response time. Reverberation
