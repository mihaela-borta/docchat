* 320 Another effect that likely influences the response time is the amount of informational masking, i.e., confusions between the target and the interferers (Carhart et al., 1969; Durlach et al., 2003; Kidd et al., 2008; Watson, 2005). Previous studies have argued that the amount of informational masking decreases with increasing number of simultaneous talkers (Carhart et al., 1975; Freyman et al., 2004; S. A. Simpson & Cooke, 2005). However, in the current study the target speaker needs to be identified by understanding the speech and to do so, listeners also need to understand the content of the interferers. Thus, the listener needs to employ a strategy to search through the auditory scene and while performing the search an interfering talker becomes a temporary target talker. Therefore, the definition of informational masking that was already controversial in classic speech perception tasks (Durlach et al., 2003; Kidd et al., 2008; Watson, 2005) becomes even more complex. How the listeners perform this task and which search strategies they employ, remains an open question and is out of the scope of the current study.
* 32 Effect of Reverberation
* 33 Reverberation was found to affect the response time only between the mid-reverberation and the high-reverberation conditions, and when there were four or more talker in a scene. In literature, it is reported that reverberation affects speech intelligibility more with few interfering talkers because potential speech gaps and pauses get 'filled' with the reverberant energy (Bolt & MacDonald, 1949; Xia et al., 2018). Such gaps generally do not exist with many overlapping speech sources (Cooke, 2006; Freyman et al., 2004). A potential explanation for the disagreement is that the task remains fairly easy with additional reverberation when few talkers are in a scene and thus, the effect of reverberation is masked.
* 34 No difference in response time was observed between the anechoic and the mid-reverberant conditions. The inexistent difference between the anechoic and the mid-reverberant condition contradicts results from previous studies where differences in speech perception between mildly
