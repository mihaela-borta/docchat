* [110] B. Material
* [111] The speech material for target and interferers was taken from a database of anechoically recorded monodogues in Danish (see (Lund et al., 2019) for details1). Each monologue was designed with characteristic features in mind, ensuring significant difference of the content. The database consists of ten monologues each spoken by ten native Danish speakers.
* [112] C. Audio-visual rooms
* [113] Three different acoustic and visual rooms were used in this study, a high-reverberant room, a mid-reverberant room and an anechoic room. The dimensions of all three rooms remained constant as shown in Figure 1, both acoustically and visually. However, the surface materials differed.
