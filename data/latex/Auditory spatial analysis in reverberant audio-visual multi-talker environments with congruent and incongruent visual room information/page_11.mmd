* 210 allows for a binary right/wrong analysis as well as a localization error in degrees. Second, the response time of the listener from audio onset to decision.
* 211 The outcome measures were analyzed using an analysis of variance of mixed linear models. The computational analyses were done using the statistical computing software R(R Core Team, 2020) and the lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2017) package. Within factor analyses were conducted using marginal means implemented in the emmeans package (Lenth, 2020) with Tukey correction for multiple comparisons.

* 213 Figure 4 shows the percentage of correctly located stories. Each bar contains 42 datapoints across the 14 participants and three repetitions. When few talkers are in a scene, the participants were able to accurately locate the correct story in all reverberation conditions. In scenes with more than five talkers, the accuracy in the high-reverberant condition (dark blue) decreases. In the mid-reverberant condition such a decrease can only be observed when eight talkers are in a scene. In the anechoic condition, the participants were able to accurately locate the target story for all numbers of talkers.
