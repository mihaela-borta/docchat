* 367 is not an exact copy of the real world. However, the influence is likely negligible in this experimental setup.
* 369 Contrary to classical speech perception studies where a %-correct or a reception threshold is determined, in the present study the response time was used as the main outcome measure.
* 371 (Drullman & Bronkhorst, 2000) used a similar speech localization/identification paradigm with sentences and words instead of ongoing speech. They showed that the trend of change in intelligibility with increasing number of talkers was similar to the trend of the response times, i.e., with more interfering talkers the intelligibility decreases, and the response time increases. While the material and the task were not fully comparable between these studies, one can expect a correlation between speech intelligibility and response time.

* 378 D. Effect of incoherent AV
* 379 Visual information is known to affect speech perception (McGurk & MacDonald, 1976). However, the effect of visual room information on auditory perception remains unclear. Previous studies showed that visual information of the room can improve auditory distance perception (Calcagno et al., 2012) and incongruent audio-visual cues can disrupt distance or externalization percepts (Gil-Carvajal et al., 2016). However, visual information has been shown to not affect the percept of reverberation (Schutte et al., 2019), which is in line with the results from the current study.
* 380 E. Limitations
* 381 The speech material (10 stories spoken by 10 talkers) was recorded specifically for this study with the aim to have distinctly different content that can be visualized with an icon. Furthermore, we aimed for natural speech as opposed to highly controlled recordings with professional speakers. This approach also comes with disadvantage; for example some stories or talkers might be easier
