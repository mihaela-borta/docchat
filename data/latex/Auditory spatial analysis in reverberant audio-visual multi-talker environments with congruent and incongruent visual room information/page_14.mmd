* [258] B. Incoherent audio-visual room information
* [264] Figure 7 shows the percentage of correctly identified stories, comparing the coherent and the incoherent audio-visual conditions with and without reverberation. The light blue/grey bars indicate the acoustically anechoic conditions and the dark bars the acoustically reverberant conditions. No differences arise from the audio-visual incongruency.

Figure 6: Localization error with respect to the number of talkers. The three colors indicate the room conditions. The boxes cover the range between the 25th and the 75th percentile. The horizontal line in the boxes indicates the median. The whiskers extend to 1.5 times the inter-quartile range. Outliers are indicated as dots.
