numerical problems and stagnation behavior due to inadequacy or low amplitude of the noise source [144]. In such a case, the leaky FxLMS (LFxLMS) algorithm and its variants were further developed within the last decade [144, 145]. The adaptation of the LFxLMS algorithm is given by [145]

\[\mathbf{w}(n+1)=(1-\mu\gamma)\mathbf{w}(n)+\mu e(n)\mathbf{X}(n), \tag{3}\]

where \(\gamma>0\) denotes the leakage factor. For \(\gamma=0\), the LFxLMS algorithm reduces to the classical FxLMS algorithm. Recently, the optimal leaky factor was proposed based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tuker (KKT) condition for the output-constrained LFxLMS algorithm [146]. Such approach provides an explicit criterion for selection of the leaky factor.

\(\bullet\)_HOEP criterion:_ The high-order error moment (HOEP) can extract extra information from the signals as compared with the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Moreover, this criterion provides a more general framework for non-Gaussian signal processing. When the environment includes some non-Gaussian components, the HOEP can improve the filtering performance. Therefore, algorithms based on the HOEP criterion may be better than the MMSE-based algorithm, such as the FxLMS algorithm. By using the HOEP criterion, the filtered-x least mean kurtosis (FxLMK) algorithm was derived in [147], which incorporates the least mean kurtosis (LMK) algorithm into feedforward ANC systems. Then, an improved version of the FxLMK algorithm was proposed, which can consistently estimate the parameters, without the need to acquire _prior information_ of the noise. Similar works can also be found in [144], in which the least mean fourth (LMF) algorithm is integrated with a leaky strategy, resulting in the leaky filtered-x LMF (LFxLMF) algorithm. These methods achieve improvements in terms of stability.

\(\bullet\)_Frequency-domain algorithms:_ When the sampling-frequency of the ANC system is high, the length of \(\hat{S}(z)\) and \(\mathbf{w}(n)\) will be large, leading to high computational complexity of the FxLMS algorithm. To reduce the computational complexity of ANC systems with high order, many frequency-domain ANC algorithms have been proposed. In these works and other similar references on the topic, the solutions generally rely on the use of a time-frequency domain wavelet packet [148, 149, 20], Fourier transform [150, 151, 152, 153, 154], and data block processing [150, 152, 154] for performance improvement. In [155], a new blind multi-channel ANC algorithm was proposed, and time and frequency-domain adaptive algorithms were developed. Blind pre-processing systems can pre-whiten the output as needed and as such time and frequency-domain adaptive algorithms converge faster than the basic multi-channel FxLMS algorithm.
