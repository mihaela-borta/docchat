Such measurement can be interpreted as a potential difference related with the sequence A (\(\mathbf{x}(n)\)\(\rightarrow\) secondary path \(S(z)\)\(\rightarrow\) filter \(\mathbf{w}(z)\)\(\rightarrow\) error signal \(e(n)\)) and the sequence B (\(\mathbf{x}(n)\)\(\rightarrow\) filter \(\mathbf{w}(z)\)\(\rightarrow\) secondary path \(S(z)\)\(\rightarrow\) error signal \(e(n)\)). The price paid for the better performance of the ANC algorithm with \(e_{c}(n)\) is an increase in computational load as compared to the other measurement schemes under evaluation.

On the other hand, retaining the residual noise with specified spectrum has become necessary to offer a better natural feeling [35]. The adaptive noise equalizer (ANE) algorithm meets the requirement of attenuating or amplifying a predetermined sinusoidal noise, whose error signal is defined by

\[e(n)\triangleq d(n)-(1-\theta)y(n) \tag{13}\]

where \(\theta\) denotes the gain value. For \(\theta=0\), it can attenuate the noise source completely; for \(\theta=0.5\), it can reduce the amplitude of the noise source by half; for \(\theta=1\), the amplitude of noise source is unchanged; for \(\theta=2\), the ANE amplifies the amplitude of the noise source by 2. By doing so, such method can meet all environments' requirements in a more flexible manner.

Alternatively, a new measurement of the error signal can be derived by implementing the virtual sensing systems [276; 277]. Among them, the remote microphone technique (RMT) is the most effective virtual sensing algorithm, which employs the offline identification of two secondary paths. One estimated transfer function of physical location \(\hat{S}_{p}(z)\) is defined according to the path between the control signal and the physical microphone position, while the other estimated transfer function of \(\hat{S}_{v}(z)\) represents the virtual locations between the control signal and the virtual microphone position. The diagram of RMT can be seen in Fig. 13, where \(e(n)\) can be interpreted as the total error signal at the virtual location, \(e_{p}(n)\) denotes the error signal from a physical microphone, \(\hat{y}_{p}(n)\) and \(\hat{y}_{v}(n)\) is the estimation of the secondary disturbance at the physical and virtual microphones, respectively, and \(\mathcal{G}(z)\) denotes the transfer function between the physical and virtual locations.
