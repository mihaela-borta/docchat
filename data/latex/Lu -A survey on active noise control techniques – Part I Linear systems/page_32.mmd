multi-channel, MIMO or large-scale ANC systems while preserving the conceptual simplicity of the classical SAFs. The graphics processing units (GPUs) offer powerful parallel processing and it also has reduced computational demand in the previous studies [6; 306]. Some algorithms for reducing complexity can also be integrated into the classic ANC algorithm, such as fast algorithms, _set-membership filtering_ and PU, moreover, the PU scheme has been applied to modify the FxLMS and FxAP algorithm [199; 307]. Note that the first attempt to simultaneously apply PU and set-membership approaches in ANC algorithms is presented for a NLANC system, but not for a linear system [308]. We reviewed these works in Part II of this work, see Table 4 in [309]. Before the past decade, several linear ANC algorithms were developed by using these schemes, see Table 15. In future research, applying both algorithms and structures to reduce complexity can be considered by resorting to research results presented in the literature before the last decade.

### Active structural acoustic control (ASAC)

To reduce device and machinery noises, an important approach is to control vibration of their casings [320]. This approach is also useful from the perspective of global noise control. A number of theoretical and experimental works have been developed for ASAC.
