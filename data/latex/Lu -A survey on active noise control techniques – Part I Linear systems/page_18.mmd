### Filtered-e ANC family

The key contributions of the filtered-e ANC algorithms before the last decade are listed in Table 5. Note that the basic filtered-e LMS (FeLMS) and filtered-x FeLMS (FxFeLMS) algorithms have been developed in 1996 and 1999, respectively.

#### 2.2.1 Filtered-e LMS-based algorithms

_1) FeLMS-based algorithms for broadband noise_

The FxLMS algorithm may converge to a biased solution when the feedforward ANC system is corrupted by noise. Moreover, it is well known that the FxLMS algorithm suffers from slow convergence speed owing to the effect of \(S(z)\). If \(|S(z)|\) has high dynamics, there are certain
