FeLMS-based algorithms for NANC. In [223], the FeLMS algorithm was intentionally introduced to deal with the noise in NANC systems. Moreover, the convergence behavior of the algorithm was analyzed. This work has proven that FeLMS-type algorithms are feasible in dealing with narrowband noise. The existing works of NANC are outlined in Table 6.

### Filtered-\(u\) ANC family

Several fundamental filtered-u ANC algorithms have been proposed before the past decade. We summarize these efforts in Table 7. In the following, the development of filtered-u ANC algorithms in the past decade is reviewed in detail.

#### 2.3.1 Filtered-\(u\) LMS-based algorithms

_1) FuLMS-based algorithms for broadband noise_

It is well known that the ANC algorithms can be extended to active vibration control (AVC) problem [231]. Among the ANC algorithms, the FuLMS algorithm can be effectively applicable to both AVC and ANC systems. The FuLMS algorithm is often used to update the weight vector of
