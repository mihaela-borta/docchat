performance may deteriorate when the secondary path varies after offline secondary path estimation. Therefore, there is a need for online secondary path estimation. The estimation of the secondary path has been addressed in previous studies, including [245, 15, 16, 246]. The fundamental of online secondary path estimation before the past decade is summarized in Table 10. The effect of the secondary path estimation error on the performance of ANC systems was presented in [14]. Interestingly, it showed that the imperfect secondary path models can improve the convergence speed, but shrink the stability bound and degrade the steady-state performance. The algorithm in [247] comprised the least squares (LS) method and the maximum likelihood (ML) principle, which requires only one parameter. However, as shown in [248], the classical statistical estimation method, such as ML, is not stable for secondary path estimation. To overcome this limitation, a Bayesian method of maximum a posteriori was suggested, which gives a feasible and stable solution to the secondary path estimation problem [248]. In [249], a tuning-less approach was derived from the method of least squares (LS). The adaptation of this rule is completely devoid of parameters, leading to easy implementation.

In addition to decreasing the number of parameters, the update ratio also plays an important role in reducing complexity. A novel filtered-x LMS-Newton algorithm was proposed, by extending the LMS-Newton algorithm to ANC systems [250]. The LMS-Newton algorithm can converge faster than the conventional LMS algorithm when the input signal is highly correlated, and it is mathematically identical to the RLS algorithm when setting \(2\mu=1-\lambda\)[251]. Moreover, the selective updating scheme was incorporated in the filtered-x LMS-Newton algorithm to reduce computational complexity of the adaptation of controller. Similar to the set-membership filtering, the selective updating scheme involves a predefined threshold to determine the feasibility solution set. For these reasons, a variable threshold strategy was further developed for performance improvement [250].

The ANC system with online secondary path estimation via auxiliary noise injection method has been extensively studied. In this method, the white Gaussian noise with zero mean is commonly used as the auxiliary noise signal. Such auxiliary noise signal is employed as the input to a classical system identification problem. However, this injected auxiliary noise can deteriorate the noise reduction performance. To overcome this problem, the variable power methods of auxiliary noise were preferred [252, 253]. In [253], an auxiliary noise-based method was designed to tackle sudden and strong changes of \(S(z)\), where a mixture of the LMS and normalized LMS (NLMS) algorithms is adopted for secondary path estimation. Alternatively, the VSS scheme can be employed for com
