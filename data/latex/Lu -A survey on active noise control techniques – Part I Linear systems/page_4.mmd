The hybrid ANC model combined the feedforward and feedback structures, whose secondary signal is generated by the sum of the output of the feedforward and feedback structures. Fig. 3 shows the diagram of a hybrid ANC model, where \(x_{b}(n)\) and \(y_{b}(n)\) are the reference signal and output of controller in the feedback structure, respectively, and \(y_{f}(n)\) is the output of the controller in the feedforward structure. Such model has high design flexibility, and it can control noise and uncorrelated narrowband interference generated by other apparatuses [22, 23]. A guideline for selecting an ANC type was proposed in [24], which analyzes the maximum achievable noise attenuation level for feed-forward, feedback, and hybrid ANC structures. Over the past decade, many efforts were conducted by using the hybrid ANC model [25, 26, 27, 16]. In what follows, we will cover these works in different categories.

Following a different direction, some sparsity-aware ANC algorithms were proposed to exploit the sparsity of the physical system [28]. The convex combination scheme was also developed for ANC to avert the conflicting requirement between fast convergence and small residue [29]. It turns out that this strategy can be applied not only to linear multi-channel ANC situations [29], but also to nonlinear ANC (NLANC) systems [30]. The ANC can cancel the noise at the microphone location. As a result of the reduction of the noise level at this point, a spatial zone of quiet (ZoQ) is created around it. However, its zones of interest are no more than a finite number of discrete points, leading to a restriction to generate 3-D quiet zones. In 2013, an ANC algorithm in 3-D space was developed, which can apply to quiet zones with comparable complexity and fills the gap in this technology [31]. Benefiting from wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), an ANC system over a network of distributed acoustic nodes was proposed, which is based on _incremental collaborative strategy_ with a sample-by-sample data acquisition in the time-domain [32]. Following this work, several distributed algorithms were presented in recent years.

Survey articles on ANC techniques have been published by many researchers [5, 33, 34, 35, 36]. However, these surveys only focus on one of the problems in ANC, and they do not cover the literature since 2013. To complete the review of ANC techniques and include the latest developments, a comprehensive review from 2009 to 2020 on linear ANC1, NLANC, and recent methods and applications are compiled in this article and the accompanying Part II. In particular, we summarize and compare the novel modeling methods and algorithms in the last ten years.
