algorithms have been widely used to control structural vibration [311, 321]. Before the past decade, many methods have been proposed for ASAC. We outline some important contributions in Table 16.

In the past decade, the ASAC techniques have been extensively used in diverse fields (helicopters [322, 323], vehicles [324], etc [325, 326, 327]). In [328], an ASAC approach was proposed for repetitive impact noises. The efficiency of the suggested optimal control configuration and the iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm was verified. In [329], an implementation of multi-channel global ANC systems was presented, which utilizes an active casing. Moreover, a distributed version of the switched-error FxLMS algorithm was developed as the control algorithm.

### Fuzzy control

The fuzzy control is one of the most appealing methods where it is impossible to sufficiently well model the inference system and the FxLMS algorithm might be failed. The early work of fuzzy control in ANC systems can be found in [330, 331], which employ the fuzzy-logic system for broadband noise control. In [332], the cross correlation between reference and error microphones signals and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimate of the cross-correlation function were used as the input of a fuzzy-logic system to adjust the coefficients of the FIR filter.

Before the past decade, the inverse fuzzy modeling techniques were investigated for ANC systems [334, 335, 336]. In particular, such techniques allow for further performance improvements in linear time invariant models. These methods generally use the _Takagi-Sugeno_ (TS) model to deal with reverberations and nonlinear distortions in ANC systems. The development of fuzzy control before the past decade is summarized in Table 17. In 2019, the fuzzy control methods were applied to
