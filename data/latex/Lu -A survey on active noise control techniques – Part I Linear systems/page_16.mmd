controller.

To assess the performance, in Fig. 8, the ANRs of the LMS and non-LMS-based algorithms are investigated. In this case, the primary path \(P(z)\) and the secondary path \(S(z)\) are generated by FIR filter with length of 256 and 100, respectively [147]. The length of the adaptive filter is set to 128. The \(\alpha\)-stable noise with \(\alpha=2\) is adopted as the noise source, which corresponds to the Gaussian distribution. One can observe that the FxRLS algorithm has the fastest convergence rate and the FxLMS algorithm suffers from slow convergence. Then, a delayless SAF algorithm for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) ANC applications was developed, which is based on Milani's work [207; 208] and can significantly mitigate the computational cost [209].

_2) Subband ANC algorithms for narrowband noise_

For most ANC systems, it is necessary to estimate the secondary path offline or online, which undoubtedly increases the computational complexity. Therefore, some subband ANC algorithms consider avoiding the secondary path estimation to reduce complexity. However, when the secondary path phase is close to \(\pm 90^{\rm o}\), the convergence rate of the algorithm is slow. To overcome this limitation, a frequency-domain delayless subband algorithm was proposed, where 4 update directions, \(180^{\rm o}\), \(0^{\rm o}\), and \(\pm 90^{\rm o}\) are adopted to single-tone and narrowband noise control [210]. The disadvantage of this method is that the filter update process must be performed in the frequency-domain, resulting in high computational complexity. To overcome this limitation, in [211], a simplified attempt was developed to cope with the implementation problem when the secondary path phase is close to \(\pm 90^{\rm o}\). Two reference signals are generated in each subband, and two update directions are
