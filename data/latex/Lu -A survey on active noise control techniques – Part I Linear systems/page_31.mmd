loop into a digital ANC system to reduce disturbances. We summarize the development of analog control for ANC in Table 14.

Note that some important analog control methods have been proposed before the past decade, and relatively few studies have been conducted in these years. In [297], a short review was presented for hybrid analog-digital systems, including six possible combinations of the classical control structures for ANC systems. The development of the analog control in recent years can also be found in [298, 299]. In [299], a continuous FxLMS algorithm was proposed for hybrid analog-to-digital systems. Moreover, an approximation of the algorithm was developed, which can be easily implemented in digital signal processor (DSP).

### Methods of reducing computational complexity

As an important structure of ANC systems, the subband ANC algorithm is well-suited for
