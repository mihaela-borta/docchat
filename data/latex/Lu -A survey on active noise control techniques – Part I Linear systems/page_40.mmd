Some fundamental frameworks of the LMS algorithm for ANC, including FxLMS, FeLMS, and FuLMS algorithms were introduced. As the non-LMS-based ANC algorithms, the type of FxAP, FxRLS, subband algorithm, and other structures ANC algorithms were investigated. It should be noted that we did not involve heuristic-based ANC algorithms in Part I, since such algorithms can also be applied to nonlinear models. Part II of this work will review NLANC techniques within the last decade, heuristic-based ANC algorithms, application of the ANC technique, and the future research challenges of ANC techniques.
