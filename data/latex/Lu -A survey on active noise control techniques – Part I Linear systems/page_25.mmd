bating performance degradation and sudden changes of \(S(z)\)[254, 255]. In [255], a scheduled-step size NLMS algorithm was employed to estimate the secondary path while suppressing disturbances from the modeling and controlling filter. In [256], both variable power and VSS strategies were employed for performance improvement.

In NANC systems, the problem of online estimation of the secondary path also needs to be considered [176, 257]. It was demonstrated that such mismatch between \(S(z)\) and \(\hat{S}(z)\) can affect the stable range of step size [13]. In [18], the effect of both offline and online secondary path modeling was examined by theoretical analysis, which shows that such imperfection can slow down the convergence rate. Then, it offered a solution to speed up the convergence. To provide an online secondary path estimation method for NANC systems, a modified FxLMS algorithm with secondary path estimation was proposed, which is based on scaled auxiliary noise injection [258]. A novel mirror-FxLMS algorithm was proposed in [259], which is based on the algorithm in [245] and can guarantee stability without an auxiliary signal to online estimate secondary path. Such an algorithm can switch between the modified FxLMS (MoFxLMS) and mirror-modified FxLMS (MMoFxLMS) algorithms according to the absolute value of their weight coefficients5. If the absolute value of the MMoFxLMS algorithm greater than the MoFxLMS, the MMoFxLMS algorithm adapts the controller; otherwise, the MoFxLMS algorithm works. The MoFxLMS algorithm can obtain improved performance under high secondary path modeling error, while the MMoFxLMS algorithm can converge fast regardless of the secondary path modeling errors. As a result, a stable performance is achieved for the overall filter. In particular, a phase-locked loop (PLL) was exploited to enhance the tracking capability.

Footnote 5: Here, the modified FxLMS is referred to the algorithm proposed by Rupp and Sayed [260]. To avoid confusion, we abbreviate this algorithm as MoFxLMS, and the modified FxLMS algorithm proposed by Akhtar is termed as MFxLMS algorithm [243].

Similarly, Akhtar combined the new algorithms with his MFxLMS algorithm for acquiring refined performance in the presence of \(\alpha\)-stable noise [181, 183]. The above examples clearly demonstrate the large potential of online secondary path estimation, not only for Gaussian noise environment, but also for impulsive noise.
