secondary path \(S(z)\) are modeled by an FIR filter with length 256 and 100, respectively. The filter length is set to 128 [147]. With similar convergence rate, the FxgsnLMS algorithm has the smallest noise residual in this scenario.

#### 2.1.2 Filtered-x AP-based algorithms

_1) FxAP-based algorithms for broadband noise_

The AP algorithm updates the weights on the basis of multiple input vectors to accelerate convergence speed if driven by highly correlated input signals. For these reasons, it has become a good alternative to LMS-type controllers. The update equation for the basic FxAP algorithm is [194]

\[\mathbf{w}(n+1)=\mathbf{w}(n)+\mu\mathbf{U}(n)\left[\mathbf{U}^{\rm T}(n)\mathbf{U}(n)\right]^{-1} \mathbf{e}(n) \tag{7}\]
