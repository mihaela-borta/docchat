In practice, noise source and noise cancellation points may be distanced and the nature of the noise field is complicated. Hence, it is natural to consider employing several reference microphones, error microphones and loudspeakers, resulting in multi-channel ANC system [356]. The cost of multi-channel ANC system is still expensive and demanding. The reasons are as follows. 1) To achieve both sufficient multiple coherence and time advance between the reference and error signals, a sufficient number of reference microphones are needed [357]. 2) The number of filtered reference signals is usually not equal to the number of reference signals [356]. To mitigate the computational complexity of the multi-channel ANC system, several methods were proposed, such as GPU-based methods [6, 306]. The theoretical behavior of the multi-channel ANC system was analyzed in [194, 139]. Recently, a decentralized control method by making use of frequency-domain processing was proposed for multi-channel ANC system [358].

_1) Incremental algorithms:_ Conventionally, the processing of multi-channel ANC systems is the _centralized_ estimation approach. However, it is well known that such an approach is not scalable and require restructuring of hardware components and reformulation of update rules for attenuate noise [359]. An effective solution is to introduce distributed ANC systems, which are motivated by distributed adaptive filtering [360]. Compared with its centralized counterpart, the distributed ANC system consumes less energy and communication resources and is therefore particularly well-suited for WASNs applications. Moreover, it offers a more robust strategy that can be efficiently exploited to reduce noise over geographical regions. The earliest work using distributed ANC systems was reported in [32], which is based on _incremental collaborative strategy_. A diagram of a distributed ANC system with an incremental collaborative strategy is shown in Fig. 16, where the distributed ANC is considered with \(K\) nodes, indexed by \(k\in\{1,\ldots,K\}\). At time instant \(n\), the observations are acquired for each noise \(\{\mathbf{X}_{k}(n),d_{k}(n)\}\), where \(\mathbf{X}_{k}(n)\) denotes the input vector, which is obtained by filtering the reference signal \(\mathbf{x}(n)\) through the \(k\)th estimated secondary path, \(d_{k}(n)\) denotes the
