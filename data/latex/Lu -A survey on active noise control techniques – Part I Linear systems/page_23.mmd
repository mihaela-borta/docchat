from this table that the LMS-based algorithms require the smallest computational complexity as compared to other algorithms and the RLS-type algorithms have the largest computational load.

## 3 Practical considerations

### Online secondary path estimation

In the previously described works and other similar references on the topic, the solutions typically rely on the assumption \(S(z)=\hat{S}(z)\). This assumption is based on the fact that the estimate \(\hat{S}(z)\) can be very similar to the true value \(S(z)\), depending on the estimation method used, the equipment, and the room conditions4. However, in many cases, the secondary path is time-varying. The
