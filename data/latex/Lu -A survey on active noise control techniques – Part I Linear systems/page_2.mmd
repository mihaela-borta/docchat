## 1 Introduction

Traditional noise control methods use passive noise control (PNC) techniques such as sealing and shielding to attenuate noise. However, such methods suffer from the bulky volume, expensive cost, and degradation performance for reducing low-frequency noise, which hinders its practical use [1]. To address this problem, active noise control (ANC) was developed, based on the principle that noise can be canceled by another noise with the same amplitude but an opposite phase [2; 3]. The development of ANC history can be found in [4; 5] and references therein.

In ANC, the most popular adaptive algorithm is the filtered-x least-mean-square (FxLMS) algorithm. The FxLMS algorithm exhibits a simple structure, thus it has been extensively studied and extended [6; 7; 8]. Fig. 1 plots the diagram of a feedforward ANC model, where \(P(z)\) denotes the primary path, \(S(z)\) denotes the secondary path, which can be used to model the acoustic path between the loudspeaker and the microphone, or the electro-acoustic path that also includes the effects of the amplifier and the driver circuit, \(\hat{S}(z)\) represents the estimate of the secondary path model, \(x(n)\) stands for the reference signal, \(d(n)\) denotes the undesired signal, \(y(n)\) denotes the output of the controller, and \(e(n)\) denotes the residual noise. Morgan's experiment demonstrated that, for the narrowband ANC (NANC) system, the convergence property of the adaptive algorithm largely relies on the phase response of the filter \(S(z)\)[9]. As the phase increases, it will oscillate and eventually cause instability in the entire ANC system. An effective solution is the introduction of the estimated secondary path, i.e., \(\hat{S}(z)\). The above method is usually referred to as _filtered_ approach. However, the secondary path increases its eigenvalue spread, and it slows down the convergence speed of the FxLMS algorithm [10; 11]. More importantly, \(\hat{S}(z)\) is not equal to \(S(z)\) in practical applications. Numerous online secondary path estimation methods were developed, which exhibit improved modeling performance than the conventional methods [12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17]. In particular, a secondary path modeling for NANC systems was presented in [18], which analyzed
