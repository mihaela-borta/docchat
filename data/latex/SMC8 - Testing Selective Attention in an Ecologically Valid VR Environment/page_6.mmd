information. A simple high-frequency hearing loss simulator was developed using the JUCE framework for C++8, and exported as an audio plugin for Unity. The hearing loss simulator consisted of a three-band peak filter to simulate the listener's hearing loss while in the VR environment. The hearing loss was simulated using information from Gunnar et al. [25], where it is stated that a common high-frequency hearing loss has at least 47, 52, and 60 dB hearing loss at the 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, and 6000 Hz respectively. The plugin was added to the master output of the Audio Mixer in Unity, and the plugin was applied after spatialization and reverberation. To make the auditory environment more dynamic, recordings of distinct voices were incorporated for the closer conversations. Two different sound events were added as potential distractive sound sources while the waiter spoke to make the auditory environment more dynamic. The first event involved loud laughter from a woman positioned to the right of the listener, while the second involved the sound of glass breaking near the bar in the scene. Additionally, any physical interactive elements were removed from the scene so that the listener would stay more focused on the auditory environment.

## 6 Final Evaluation

When the second iteration had been implemented, the virtual environment was finally tested on 13 participants to see if it could detect participants' challenges with selective attention. The aim of the evaluation was to assess whether the participants' behavior in the prototype (i.e. through eye-tracking) along with a short questionnaire could reveal information about the participants' auditory attention and whether participants' hearing loss would be detectable in the results. The main change in the setup from the usability testing was that participants were asked to wear noise-cancelling headphones on top of the VR headset in the test. The loudness of the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones was measured before the test to ensure that the sound levels were at the desired level. The participants were not informed what the experiment was about. They were only asked to familiarize themselves with the scene before starting the scenario. The participants then played out the scenario alone in a room while sitting on a stationary chair and then answered an online questionnaire afterwards. The full questionnaire can be found in Appendix B. The total length of the simulated experience was 1 minute and 21 seconds. The participants with hearing loss simulation were chosen randomly and 6 out of the 13 participants had the simulation running.

### Demographics

Out of the 13 participants in the evaluation, one participant had partial hearing impairment on both ears, so they are considered individually in the analysis of the results. The participants' ages ranged from 23 to 40 years, with an average age of 28 years. All participants reported their proficiency in English as either advanced or fluent. Two participants had no experience with Virtual Reality.

### Results

The results are split into two groups: Normal Hearing [NH] and Hearing Loss [HL], depending on whether the participants had a hearing loss simulator running or not. The participants were asked to rate 14 items from the IPQ scale on a 5-point scale where the lowest possible rating was 1 and the highest was 5. The IPQ scale measures Spatial Presence, Involvement, and Experienced Realism in a virtual environment. The questionnaire also includes one item for General Presence.
