then played, and the participants interacted with it as they pleased. When the scene was over, the participants rated some aspects of the experience through an online questionnaire and were also asked to give verbal feedback on their experience.

#### 4.3.1 Participants

The participants were all affiliated with the Sound and Music Computing program at Aalborg University. All of the participants had some experience with VR, and none of the participants had any hearing impairment.

#### 4.3.2 Results

In general, the participants felt that the sound was immersive and realistic, but there were a few comments about the loudness of some conversations not being realistic enough. The waiter was perceived to be more quiet than in a real-world scenario, and the two close conversations were perceived to be louder than in a real-world scenario. One participant also mentioned that the scene lacked some depth because they could not sense the distance between them and the different background noises. One participant mentioned that awareness of people's surroundings would play a part in a real-world scenario, so people close to you would not speak as loudly as in the virtual scenario. Most participants also commented on the characters in the scene moving in an unrealistic and "exaggerated" way.

## 5 Iteration II

The animations were switched out for other animations from Mixamo that had fewer "exaggerated" movements. The loudness in the headphones was measured with a sound level meter by placing the meter inside the headphone cub. The desired loudness level was based on research from Weisser et al. (2019) [24], where recordings from two cafes were measured to have a sound pressure level of approximately 71 dB. The waiter's loudness was made to be 6 dB louder than the conversations close to the listener, which would make the conversations' have a "Normal" voice level and the waiter have a "Raised" voice level. The desired levels were acquired from The Engineering Toolbox 7. This was implemented to account for the expectation that people close to you in a public place will slightly lower the volume of their conversation, while waiters tend to speak a bit louder to ensure effective communication of
