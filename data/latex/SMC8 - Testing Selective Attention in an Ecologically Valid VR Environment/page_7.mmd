a participant was looking at the waiter, the man or woman in each close conversation, the bar area, or any other object in the scene. Due to a technical issue, the eye-tracking data of one participant could not be retrieved, so it was only possible to analyze data from 5 participants in the NH group. The amount of time spent looking at the waiter during his speech varied a lot between participants. The HL group spent a slightly longer time looking at the waiter, as can be seen in Table 5.

Results for the average amount of time spent looking at the different categories in the scene can be found in Appendix A.

The questionnaire presented the participants with 10 different items and asked them to select the items that they heard mentioned by the waiter. 4 of the items were actually mentioned by the waiter and 6 of them were not. The NH group had a higher average score than the HL group.

Regarding the directions from which participants felt they could clearly distinguish speech, the results can be seen in Figures 8 and 9. The most prominent sound sources are the waiter at 0\({}^{\circ}\), the right conversation at 45\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\) and the left conversation at 270\({}^{\circ}\) and 315\({}^{\circ}\). Other background noises were scattered around the listener, mainly in the 90-270\({}^{\circ}\) area.

The results for the hearing-impaired participant playing the scene normally can be seen in Table 7.

## 7 General Discussion

The challenge of simulating a real-world environment in VR introduces multiple biases. Although the virtual environment may look and sound realistic, participants are often very aware of the fact that they are in a virtual world,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Group & Score & Correct & Incorrect \\ \hline NH & 81.7\% & 62.5\% \\  & (\(\sigma\) = \(\sigma\) = \(26.2\%\)) & 5.5\% \\ \hline HL & 66.7\% & 37.5\% \\  & (\(\sigma\) = \(13.7\%\)) & (\(\sigma\) = \(13.7\%\)) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: The average scores for the two groupsâ€™ understanding of what the waiter said, the amount of items guessed correctly and items guessed incorrectly.
