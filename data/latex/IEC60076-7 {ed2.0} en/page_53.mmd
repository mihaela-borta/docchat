* the hot-spot is not always located at the top of the winding. However, this formulation is a practical solution to overcome this issue.

The \(Q\) factor is a dimensionless factor as a ratio of two losses, and in cylindrical coordinates can be defined as:

\[Q=Q(r,z,\varphi,T)/Q_{\text{ave}}\] (D.3)

where

\(Q(r,z,\varphi,T)\) is the local loss density at a location (W/m\({}^{3}\));

\(r\) is the radial position;

\(\varphi\) is the angle in circumferential position;

\(z\) is the axial position;

\(T\) is the local temperature at (\(r\), \(z\), \(\varphi\)), and

\(Q_{\text{ave}}\) is the average loss of the winding at average temperature.

For calculation purposes, one can redefine the \(Q\) factor for a disc winding in which each disc has several conductors in radial direction and consists of numerous discs in axial direction, as:

\[Q=Q(conductor\_number\_in\_disc,disk\_number,\varphi,T)/Q_{\text{ave}}\] (D.4)

The \(Q\) factor is a scalar function and is based on the steady state condition of a defined loading at a defined tap position (if applicable).

It is important to note that the \(Q\) factor in this definition is not a ratio of temperatures but a ratio of losses.

Finally the \(S\) factor used in this document is defined as:

\[S=\frac{H}{Q}\] (D.5)

which can be easily calculated as soon as \(H\) and \(Q\) are known.

This \(S\) factor is an indication of the local cooling inefficiency. Higher \(S\) factor means higher local temperature gradient thus worse cooling efficiency.

According to the current IEC 60076-2 calculation this \(S\) factor should be calculated as the ratio of local hot-spot gradient over winding gradient with constant heat losses. With this definition the \(S\) factor is proportional to the ratio of two thermal resistances, resulting in:

\[S\propto S(r,z,\varphi,T)/S_{\text{ave}}\] (D.6)

where

\(S(r,z,\varphi,T)\) is the local cooling resistance (K/W), and

\(S_{\text{ave}}\) is the average cooling resistance (K/W).

We should note that heat transfer can be in different directions. The (overall) local heat transfer consists of series and parallel parts, such as:

* the insulation between the neighbouring conductors, that are in direct contact with each other, in the radial direction.
