* current flowing in the highest rated winding is considered;
* the tap position that gives the rated voltage on the lower voltage side with rated voltage on the higher voltage side taking account of the voltage drop caused by the preload for a unity power factor load;
* a preload of 0,75 p.u.;
* a duration of 15 min;
* all normal cooling in service appropriate to the preload condition but with no standby cooling capacity
* Loading according to a specific cycle

Specify in detail the load and ambient temperature cycles.
