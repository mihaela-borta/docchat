## 6 Plot the output data

Since the elapsed time of the plot is 2 h or 0,083 3 days, and the loss of life is 6,15 days, the relative loss of life during this overload is 6,15/0,083 3 = 74 times normal. This is not serious if there are otherwise long periods of time (usually the case) at relatively low hot-spot temperatures.

### Use of measured top-oil temperature

If top-oil temperature is available as a measured quantity, for example as a 4 mA to 20 mA signal to the monitoring device, then the calculations become more accurate. Hot-spot temperature rise is calculated from difference Equations (20), (21) and (22) and added directly to the measured top-oil temperature data, at each time step. See the dashed line path in Figure 12.
