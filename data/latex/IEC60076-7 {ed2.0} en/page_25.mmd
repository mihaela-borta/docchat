### Specific limitations for small transformers

#### 7.3.1 Current and temperature limitations

The limits on load current, hot-spot temperature, top-oil temperature and temperature of metallic parts other than windings and leads stated in Table 2 and Table 3 should not be exceeded. No limit is set for the top-oil, core and winding hot-spot temperature under short-time emergency loading for distribution transformers because it is usually impracticable to control the duration of emergency loading in this case. It should be noted that when the hot-spot temperature exceeds 140 \({}^{\circ}\)C, gas bubbles may develop which could jeopardize the dielectric strength of the transformer (see 5.3).

#### 7.3.2 Accessory and other considerations

Apart from the windings, other parts of the transformer, such as bushings, cable-end connections, tap-changing devices and leads may restrict the operation when loaded above 1,5 times the rated current. Oil expansion and oil pressure could also impose restrictions.

#### 7.3.3 Indoor transformers

When transformers are used indoors, a correction should be made to the rated top-oil temperature rise to take account of the enclosure. Preferably, this extra temperature rise will be determined by a test (see 8.3.2).

#### 7.3.4 Outdoor ambient conditions

Wind, sunshine and rain may affect the loading capacity of distribution transformers, but their unpredictable nature makes it impracticable to take these factors into account.

### Specific limitations for medium power transformers

#### 7.4.1 Current and temperature limitations

The load current, hot-spot temperature, top-oil temperature and temperature of metallic parts other than windings and leads should not exceed the limits stated in Table 2 and Table 3. Moreover, it should be noted that, when the hot-spot temperature exceeds 140 \({}^{\circ}\)C, gas bubbles may develop which could jeopardize the dielectric strength of the transformer (see 5.3).

#### 7.4.2 Accessory, associated equipment and other considerations

Apart from the windings, other parts of the transformer, such as bushings, cable-end connections, tap-changing devices and leads, may restrict the operation when loaded above
