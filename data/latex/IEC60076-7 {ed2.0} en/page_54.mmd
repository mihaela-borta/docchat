* the insulation paper and oil boundary layer between conductor and the oil flow in axial direction. Note that heat transfer functions for the oil boundary layer are often function of \(q^{*}\).
* the copper (which almost can be neglected) in the tangential direction.

This implies that the \(Q\) and \(S\) factors are not fully independent, because they are linked by temperature, heat flux, etc. For example, if the local losses are higher, the local temperature will also increase and will influence the local flow stream and the local convection heat transfer coefficient from conductor to oil.

**Remark 1**: We should note that the size of one (paper insulated) conductor is the smallest element in which one calculates the losses. Inside each element there exists the same temperature, so thermal resistances inside the element are neglected. In the case one calculates the \(Q\) factor based on a number of conductors in one (or sometimes even 4) top discs, one increases in essence the element size to a large extent and one neglects the temperature distribution between conductors in the disc (and even between discs), which results in a too low estimate of the hot-spot. The approach of using one or more discs as smallest element results in a too low estimate of the hot-spot temperature and should be rejected.

**Remark 2**: In the case of a high \(Q\) factor in a transformer, one is able to limit the hot-spot factor by creating locally more cooling surface and so design for a low \(S\) factor at that location. This principle is easy to do by adding an axial cooling channel inside a radial spacer disc or by adding a radial spacer inside a winding with axial cooling channels. The location of the hot-spot does not necessarily have to correspond with the location of the maximum losses.
