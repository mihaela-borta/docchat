## 4 - Solve the difference equations

At \(n=0\), \(t=0\), \(\theta_{0(0)}=63,9\) (units are omitted; traditionally \({}^{\circ}\)C for temperatures and K for temperature differences)

\(\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}1(0)}=53,2\)

\(\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}2(0)}=26,6\)

\(L_{(0)}=0\)

At \(n=1\), \(t=3\) min, from Equations (18) and (19), the top-oil temperature changes as follows:

\(D\theta_{0(1)}=\frac{3}{0,5\times 150}\left[\left[\frac{1+0,87^{2}\times 8}{1+8} \right]^{0,8}\times 45-\left[63,9-29,9\right]\right]=0,121\) and

\(\theta_{0(1)}=\theta_{0(0)}+D\theta_{0(1)}=63,9+0,121=64,0\)

Similarly, from Equation (20), the hot-spot temperature rise first term changes as follows:

\(D\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}1(1)}=\frac{3}{2,0\times 7}\left(2,0\times 35 \times 0,87^{13}-53,2\right)=1,12\) and

\(\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}1(1)}=\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}1(0)}+D\Delta\theta_{ \texttt{h}1(1)}=53,2+1,12=54,3\)

Similarly, from Equation (21), the hot-spot temperature rise second term changes as follows:

\(D\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}2(1)}=\frac{3}{(1/2,0)\times 150}\left(2,0-1 \right)\times 35\times 0,87^{13}-26,6\right)=0,104\) and

\(\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}2(1)}=\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}2(0)}+D\Delta\theta_{ \texttt{h}2(1)}=26,6+0,104=26,7\)

Then the total hot-spot temperature rise, from Equation (22) is

\(\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}(1)}=\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}1(1)}-\Delta\theta_{ \texttt{h}2(1)}=54,3-26,7=27,6\)

and, finally, the hot-spot temperature is, from Equation (23)

\(\theta_{\texttt{h}(1)}=\theta_{0(1)}+\Delta\theta_{\texttt{h}(1)}=64,0+27,6=91,6\)

The loss of life \(L\) over this time step is given by Equation (25):

\(DL_{(1)}=V_{(1)}\times Dt=\left[\frac{15\,000}{1710+273}\frac{15\,000}{\theta_ {\texttt{h}(1)}+273}\right]\times 3=0,42\) min

(Loss of life under rated conditions would have been 3 min.)

The total loss of life to this point is:

\(L_{(1)}=L_{(0)}+DL_{(1)}=0+0,42\) min, or 0,000 29 days.
