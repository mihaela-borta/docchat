## Calculation of winding and oil time constant

The winding time constant is as follows:

\[\tau_{\rm W}=\frac{m_{\rm w}\times c_{\rm w}\times g}{60\times P_{\rm w}}\] (E.1)

where

\(\tau_{\rm w}\) is the winding time constant in min at the load considered;

\(g\) is the winding-to-oil gradient in K at the load considered;

\(m_{\rm w}\) is the bare mass of the winding in kg;

\(c_{\rm w}\) is the specific heat of the conductor material in Ws/(kg\(\cdot\)K) ( 390 for Cu and 890 for Al);

\(P_{\rm w}\) is the winding loss in W at the load considered.

Another form of Equation (E.1) is

\[\tau_{\rm W}=2,75\times\frac{g}{(1+P_{\rm e})\times s^{2}}\;\;\mbox{for}\;\; \mbox{Cu}\] (E.2)

\[\tau_{\rm W}=1,15\times\frac{g}{(1+P_{\rm e})\times s^{2}}\;\;\mbox{for}\;\; \mbox{Al}\] (E.3)

where

\(P_{\rm e}\) is the relative winding eddy loss in p.u.;

\(s\) is the current density in A/mm\({}^{2}\) at the load considered.

The top-oil time constant is calculated according to the principles in references [27] and [31]. It means that the thermal capacity \(C\) for the ONAN, ONAF, OF and OD cooling modes is:

\[C=c_{\rm W}\times m_{\rm W}+c_{\rm FE}\times m_{\rm FE}+c_{\rm T}\times m_{ \rm T}+k_{\rm O}\times c_{\rm O}\times m_{\rm O}\] (E.4)

where

\(m_{\rm W}\) is the mass of coil assembly in kg;

\(m_{\rm FE}\) is the mass of core in kg;

\(m_{\rm T}\) is the mass of the tank and fittings in kg (only those portions that are in contact with heated oil should be used, i.e. 2/3 of tank weight should be considered);

\(m_{\rm O}\) is the mass of oil in kg;

\(c_{\rm w}\) is the specific heat capacity of the winding material (390 for Cu and 890 for Al) in Ws/kgK;

\(c_{\rm FE}\) is the specific heat capacity of the core (= 468) in Ws/kgK;

\(c_{\rm T}\) is the specific heat capacity of the tank and fittings (= 468) in Ws/kgK;

\(c_{\rm O}\) is the specific heat capacity of the oil (= 1800) in Ws/kgK;

\(k_{\rm O}\) is the correction factor for the oil in the ONAF, ONAN, OF and OD cooling modes.

The correction factor for the oil, \(k_{\rm O}\), is the ratio of average to maximum top-oil temperature rise.
