The limits given in Table 2 are applicable to transformers specified to have temperature rise requirements according to IEC 60076-2. For transformers specified according to IEC 60076-14, with a higher thermal class insulation materials, the limits given in IEC 60076-14 apply.

### Current limitations

There are limitations on current carrying capability of transformer other than temperature limits given in Table 2, and these are described in 7.3 to 7.5. Therefore, it is recommended that the current limits given in Table 3 are not exceeded even if the circumstances of the overload mean that the temperatures in Table 2 are not exceeded. Specific examples would be in cases of low ambient temperature, low levels of preload or high thermal capacity of the winding. The purchaser can specify higher current limits if required, but it should be recognized that this could lead to a special transformer design. The recommended current limits given in Table 3 should not apply to very short duration overloads, i.e. less than 10 s.
