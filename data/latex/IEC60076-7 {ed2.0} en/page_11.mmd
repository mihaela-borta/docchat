POWER TRANSFORERS -

Part 7: Loading guide for mineral-oil-immersed

power transformers

## 1 Scope

This part of IEC 60076 is applicable to mineral-oil-immersed transformers. It describes the effect of operation under various ambient temperatures and load conditions on transformer life.

NOTE For furnace transformers, the manufacturer is consulted in view of the peculiar loading profile.

## 2 Normative references

The following documents are referred to in the text in such a way that some or all of their content constitutes requirements of this document. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.

IEC 60076-2, _Power transformers - Part 2: Temperature rise for liquid-immersed transformers_

IEC 60076-14, _Power transformers - Part 14: Liquid-immersed power transformers using high-temperature insulation materials_

## 3 Terms and definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.

### small power transformer

power transformer without attached radiators, coolers or tubes including corrugated tank irrespective of rating

### medium power transformer

power transformer with a maximum rating of 100 MVA three-phase or 33,3 MVA single-phase

### large power transformer

power transformer with a maximum rating of greater than 100 MVA three-phase or greater than 33,3 MVA single-phase

### cyclic loading

loading with cyclic variations (the duration of the cycle usually being 24 h) which is regarded in terms of the accumulated amount of ageing that occurs during the cycle

Note 1 to entry: The cyclic loading may either be a normal loading or a long-time emergency loading.
