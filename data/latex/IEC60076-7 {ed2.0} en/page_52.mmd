## Appendix D Description of \(Q\), \(S\) and \(H\) factors

IEC 60076-2 notes also that the hot-spot factor \(H\) is obtained by the product of the \(Q\) and \(S\) factors:

\[H=QS\] (D.1)

The \(Q\) and \(S\) factors are dimensionless factors described in IEC 60076-2 as:

* \(Q\) is "a dimensionless factor to estimate the increase of the average winding gradient due to the local increase of additional loss."
* \(S\) is "a dimensionless factor to estimate the local increase of the average winding gradient due to the variation in the oil flow stream."

According these definitions, \(Q\) should be calculated by modelling the winding with the correct heat loss distribution, but with uniform oil velocity. The \(Q\) factor is then the ratio of the maximal winding to local oil gradient over the average winding to average oil gradient.

On the other hand, \(S\) should be calculated by modelling the winding with uniform heat losses and with the correct oil velocity inside the winding. The \(S\) factor is the ratio of the maximal winding to local oil gradient over the average winding to average oil gradient.

However after calculating \(Q\) and \(S\) in line with the IEC 60076-2 definition, the hot-spot factor \(H\) cannot be calculated directly as the product of \(Q\) and \(S\) factors, as mentioned in IEC 60076-2, because:

* discs with maximal \(Q\) factor and discs with maximal \(S\) factor can (and probably will) be different discs;
* when modelling the winding with correct heat loss distribution and oil flows, \(Q\) and \(S\) factors will not be independent from each other as explained later.

For the above reasons, CIGRE WG A2.38 [18] proposes more practical definitions of \(Q\) and \(S\) and \(H\) factors, as given below.

The \(H\) factor can be derived out of Figure 6 and is:

\[H=\frac{P-B}{I-\frac{B+D}{2}}\] (D.2)

Equation (D.2) is different from the current IEC 60076-2 definition, because the hot-spot temperature is referenced to the mixed top-oil, while increase in local winding to oil gradient refers to local winding oil.

This formula for \(H\) has the following advantages:

* the \(H\) factor can be calculated directly from the calculation results (calculated with correct loss and oil flow distribution);
* this is the correct hot-spot factor to predict the hot-spot temperature out of the temperature rise results, obtained in the standard temperature rise test;
* this hot-spot factor can also be checked in case fibre optic measurements are made (the hot-spot temperature is known);
