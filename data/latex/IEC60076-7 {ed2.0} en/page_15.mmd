## 5 Effect of loading beyond nameplate rating

### General

The normal life expectancy is a conventional reference basis for continuous duty under design ambient temperature and rated operating conditions. The application of a load in excess of nameplate rating and/or an ambient temperature higher than design ambient temperature involves a degree of risk and accelerated ageing. It is the purpose of this part of IEC 60076 to identify such risks and to indicate how, within limitations, transformers may be loaded in excess of the nameplate rating. These risks can be reduced by the purchaser clearly specifying the maximum loading conditions and the supplier taking these into account in the transformer design.

### General consequences

The consequences of loading a transformer beyond its nameplate rating are as follows.

1. The temperatures of windings, cleats, leads, insulation and oil will increase and can reach unacceptable levels.
2. The leakage flux density outside the core increases, causing additional eddy-current heating in metallic parts linked by the leakage flux.
3. As the temperature changes, the moisture and gas content in the insulation and in the oil will change.
4. Bushings, tap-changers, cable-end connections and current transformers will also be exposed to higher stresses which encroach upon their design and application margins.

The combination of the main flux and increased leakage flux imposes restrictions on possible core overexcitation [6, 7, 8].

NOTE For loaded core-type transformers having an energy flow from the outer winding (usually HV) to the inner winding (usually LV), the maximum magnetic flux density in the core, which is the result of the combination of the main flux and the leakage flux, appears in the yokes.

As tests have indicated, this flux is less than or equal to the flux generated by the same applied voltage on the terminals of the outer winding at no-load of the transformer. The magnetic flux in the core legs of the loaded transformer is determined by the voltage on the terminals of the inner winding and almost equals the flux generated by the same voltage at no-load.

For core-type transformers with an energy flow from the inner winding, the maximum flux density is present in the core-legs. Its value is only slightly higher than that at the same applied voltage under no-load. The flux density in the yokes is then determined by the voltage on the outer winding.
