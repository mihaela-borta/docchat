### Top-oil and hot-spot temperatures at varying ambient temperature and load conditions

#### 8.2.1 General

Subclause 8.2 provides two alternative ways of describing the hot-spot temperature as a function of time, for varying load current and ambient temperature:

1. exponential equations solution [18], [21];
2. difference equations solution [22].

Both of these methods are suitable for arbitrarily time-varying load factor \(K\) and time-varying ambient temperature \(\theta_{\text{a}}\). The former method is particularly more suited to determination of the heat transfer parameters by test, especially by manufacturers, while the latter method is more suitable for on-line monitoring due to applied mathematical transformation. In principle, both methods yield the same results as they represent solution variation to the identical heat transfer differential equations.

The heat transfer differential equations are represented in block diagram form in Figure 12.

Observe in Figure 12 that the inputs are the load factor \(K\), and the ambient temperature \(\theta_{\text{a}}\) on the left. The output is the calculated hot-spot temperature \(\theta_{\text{h}}\) on the right. The Laplace variable \(s\) is essentially the derivative operator d/d\(t\).
