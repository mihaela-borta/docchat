continues with the losses produced by 125 % of the rated current for 1 h. This is followed with the transformer shut down in order to measure the warm resistance and to estimate the corresponding average winding to average oil gradient.

Based on the extended run test results the exponent \(x\) is obtained as the slope of the line on log-log chart that bests fits the plot of the top-oil temperature rise measured at the end of the three temperature tests (70 % + \(P_{\text{fe}}\), 100 % + \(P_{\text{fe}}\) and 125 % + \(P_{\text{fe}}\)) versus the loss equation, Figure G.2 a. Correspondingly, exponent \(y\) is the slope of the line on log-log chart that best fits the plot of the average winding temperature rise above average top-oil temperature measured at the end of three temperature tests (70 %, 100 % and 125 %) versus the loading factor Figure G.2 b. This method assumes that the hot-spot rise over top-oil temperature is proportional to the average winding rise over average oil temperature.

The slopes should be determined by the slopes of the lines that best fit the data points plotted using the least-square method.
