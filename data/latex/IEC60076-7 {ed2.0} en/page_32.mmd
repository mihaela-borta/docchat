addition to the DC resistance loss. Connections that are subject to leakage flux heating, such as coil-to-coil connections and some tap-to-winding brazes, should also be considered.
3. Conduction heat transfer effects within the winding caused by the various insulation thicknesses used throughout the winding.
4. Local design features or local fluid flow restrictions. * Layer insulation may have a different thickness throughout a layer winding, and insulation next to the cooling duct affects the heat transfer. * Flow-directing washers reduce the heat transfer into the fluid in the case of a zigzag-cooled winding (Figure 10). * Possible extra insulation on end turns and on winding conductors exiting through the end insulation. * Not all cooling ducts extend completely around the winding in distribution transformers and small power transformers. Some cooling ducts are located only in the portion of the winding outside the core (see Figure 11). Such a "collapsed duct arrangement" causes a circumferential temperature gradient from the centre of the winding with no ducts under the yoke to the centre of the winding outside core where cooling ducts are located. *
