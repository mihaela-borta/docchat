Core temperature

### General

In transformer cores, there are two different core hot-spots which, if not controlled, can cause insulation material degradation and subsequent gassing.

1. [label=)]
2. Core hot-spot inside the core, should be limited to 130 \({}^{\circ}\)C under conditions of highest core excitation, rated load and maximum ambient temperature. This is in order to prevent the core heating which results in the break-up of the thin oil film between core laminations, the consequence of which is the generation of mainly H\({}_{2}\) and CH\({}_{4}\), in addition to small quantities of other hydrocarbons [29, 30]. It is important to understand that any possible oil gas saturation should be prevented.
3. Core surface hot-spot, which is in contact with oil and solid insulation materials, should be limited according to Table 2.

### Core hot-spot locations

The location of the internal core hot-spot depends largely on the core type and whether it is a shell form or a core form transformer. In the most common core type (three-phase, three-limb cores), this hot-spot is located in the middle of the top yoke between cooling ducts. In other core types, the location of the core hot-spot is typically at the top of the middle core limb [30].

The total core surface temperature rise is the sum of the following three components:

1. [label=)]
2. temperature rise due to the leakage flux impinging on the surface of the laminations of the outermost core step(s) - this value can vary from a few kelvins to several tens of kelvins over the adjacent oil depending on the transformer winding, core, and tank shielding design;
3. temperature rise due to the main flux in the core - this value can again vary from a few kelvins to several tens of kelvins over the adjacent oil depending on the transformer core design (diameter and number of cooling ducts), core induction, and core material;
4. temperature rise of the oil around the area of the surface hot-spot.

Therefore, in almost all cores, this core surface hot-spot is not located in the yoke but is located at the top of the middle core-limb, where the leakage flux enters the surface of the core laminations. Also, the relative magnitudes of the temperature rise due to the leakage flux versus the rise due to the core main flux depends wholly on the design of the transformer.

Consequently, the correct way to determine the core surface hot-spot is to determine the temperature increase at rated load (including temperature rise of adjacent oil) and add to it the temperature rise due to the highest core over-excitation. These temperatures are to be determined for the appropriate location of the core surface hot-spot in the core type evaluated.
