## 7.3 Specification of loading beyond rated power

This document gives advice on the calculation of the capability of an existing transformer to be loaded beyond rated power. All transformers will have some overload capability. However since no specific loading requirements beyond rated power are specified in IEC 60076-1 [5] or IEC 60076-2 [52], it is up to the purchaser to specify any particular loading requirements (load, duration and ambient temperature).

Specification of loading beyond rated power can be done in the following ways.

1. Long time emergency loading Since the hot-spot temperature limit in IEC 60076-2 is less than that given in Table 2, it is possible to have an increased loading available for emergency situations provided that the loss of life is accepted. The extent of this loading capability will depend on ambient temperature, while preload and the duration of loading are only relevant to loss of life. The following need to be specified at the enquiry stage: 1. the ambient temperature at which the loading is required; 2. the load as per unit (p.u.) of rated current; 3. the winding(s) to which the loading is to be applied; 4. the tap position; 5. the cooling stage(s) in service. If loading according to this document is specified, then the transformer should not exceed the temperatures and currents given in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively, under the following conditions: * a yearly average ambient temperature (20 \({}^{\circ}\)C unless otherwise specified); * current flowing in the highest rated winding is considered; * the tap position that gives the rated voltage on the lower voltage side with rated voltage on the higher voltage side taking account of the voltage drop caused by the load for a unity power factor load; * all normal cooling in service but with no standby cooling capacity. 2. Short time emergency loading If the transformer is used at a load less than rated current, then there will be an additional short time loading capability caused by the thermal time constants of the oil and windings. If a specific short time loading capability is required then the following need to be specified: 1. the ambient temperature at which the loading is required; 2. the short time current that is required in p.u. of rated current; 3. the winding(s) to which the load will be applied; 4. the tap position; 5. the preload current applied before the short time emergency loading in p.u. of rated current; 6. the duration of the loading; 7. the cooling stage(s) in service. If loading according to this document is specified, then the transformer should not exceed the temperatures and currents given in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively, and under the following conditions: * a yearly average ambient temperature (20 \({}^{\circ}\)C unless otherwise specified);
