From kraft pulp various types of paper and pressboard having varying density are made. By adding various nitrogen containing compounds the ageing characteristics of the cellulose may be improved. Typical values for nitrogen content of thermally upgraded papers are between 1 % and 4 %. The purpose of thermally upgrading insulation paper is to neutralize the production of acids caused by the hydrolysis (thermal degradation) of the material over the lifetime of the transformer.

### Insulation life

In recent years, extensive work on paper degradation has been carried out and published in references [9] to [15], indicating that cellulose ageing may be described by combination of the three processes, i.e. oxidation, hydrolysis and pyrolysis.

The oxidation is a process possibly dominant at lower temperature. The oxidizing agent in this environment is oxygen from air ingress, and as the ultimate end product of the process appears water. The hydrolysis of cellulose is a catalytically governed process where the rate of chain scissions depends on carboxylic acids dissociated in water. As both water and carboxylic acids are produced during ageing of cellulose this process is auto accelerating. The pyrolysis is a process that can take place without access to water and/or oxygen, or any other agent to initiate the decomposition. At normal operating or overload temperatures, (i.e. < 140 \({}^{\circ}\)C), such processes are considered to be of little relevance.

In a real transformer all these processes - hydrolysis, oxidation and pyrolysis - act simultaneously. This hampers the application of one model describing the full complexity of the degradation processes. Which process will dominate depends on the temperature and the condition (i.e. oxygen, water and acid content).

Different parameters might be used to characterize cellulose degradation process during ageing. In reality it is the mechanical strength that is important for the winding paper to resist the shear stresses occurring during short circuits. However, due to the folded geometry of paper in a transformer, it is not possible to analyse tensile strength of paper sampled from used transformers. Hence, it is more convenient to characterize the degree of polymerization (DP) in order to describe the state of an insulation paper. Figure 2 shows a typical correlation between tensile strength and DP value (see [11]), the same correlation is valid for the thermally upgraded and non-thermally upgraded paper.
