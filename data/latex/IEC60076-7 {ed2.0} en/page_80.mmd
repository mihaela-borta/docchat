## Example of calculating and presenting overload data

Annex K contains an example of how to calculate and present the overload data with the equations presented in this document.

Table K.1 gives, as an example, some characteristics that might be used.

With a spreadsheet programme, a 24 h period is created, with the time-scale in minutes. Equations (10) to (17) are used to calculate for each minute the hot-spot temperature as a function of the load. The initial conditions for \(\Delta\theta_{\text{oli}}\) and \(\Delta\theta_{\text{hi1}}\), \(\Delta\theta_{\text{hi2}}\) can be determined with \(t\rightarrow\infty\).

When the hot-spot temperature is known, the relative ageing can be calculated with Equation (2). With Equation (4) the loss of life, expressed in "normal" days, can be calculated by dividing the sum of the relative ageing of each minute by 1440.

For example, consider a case with a pre-load (\(K_{1}\)) of 0,8, then an overload \(K_{2}\) = 1,4 during 30 min and return to \(K_{1}\) = 0,8 for the time remaining (1410 min). The transformer is OF cooled; therefore, the example characteristics of Table H.1 (OF) are used.
