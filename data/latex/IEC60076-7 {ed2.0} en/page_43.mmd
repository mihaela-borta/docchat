### Load loss

The transformer's short-circuit loss is a function of the tap position. Several different connections of the tapped windings and the main winding can be realized. A universal approach to calculate the transformer's ratio of losses as a function of the tap position is shown in Figure 15. A linear function is calculated between the rated tap position and the minimum and maximum position. Figure 15 can be changed according to regulating winding arrangement regarding tapping method selected.

### Ratio of losses

The transformer's top-oil temperature rise is a function of the loss ratio \(R\). The no-load losses are assumed to be constant. Using a linear approximation, \(R\) can be determined as a function of the tap position.

For tap positions beyond the rated tap-changer position (from \(\text{tap}_{r+1}\) to \(\text{tap}_{\text{max}}\)):

\[R(\text{tap})=R_{r+1}+(\text{tap}-\text{tap}_{r+1})\times m_{2} \tag{29}\]

For tap positions below the rated tap position (from \(\text{tap}_{\text{min}}\) to \(\text{tap}_{r}\)):

\[R(\text{tap})=R_{r}+(\text{tap}-\text{tap}_{r})\times m_{1} \tag{30}\]

### Load factor

The winding-to-oil temperature rise mainly depends on the load factor. \(K\) is not dependent on the tap position.
