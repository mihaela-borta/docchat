may be used. These values should be divided by two to obtain the approximate extra top-oil temperature rise.

#### 8.3.3 Water-cooled transformers

For water-cooled transformers, the ambient temperature is the temperature of the incoming water, which shows less variation in time than air.

## 9 Influence of tap-changers

### General

All quantities used in Equations (10), (11), (13), (14), (15), (16) and (17) have to be appropriate for the tap at which the transformer is operating.

For example, consider the case where the HV voltage is constant, and it is required to maintain a constant LV voltage for a given load. If this requires the transformer to be on a +15 % tap on the LV side, the rated oil temperature rise, losses and winding gradients have to be measured or calculated for that tap.

Consider also the case of an auto transformer with a line-end tap-changer - the series winding will have maximum current at one end of the tapping range whilst the common winding will have maximum current at the other end of the tapping range.

They are based on the results of a series of natural and forced cooling tests in underground vaults and substations and on random measurements in substations and kiosks.

* This correction for kiosk enclosures is not necessary when the temperature rise test has been carried out on the transformer in the enclosure as one complete unit.
