## Appendix G Oil and winding exponents

### General

The traditional oil exponent, \(x\) = 0,8, and winding exponent, \(y\) = 1,6, have been used since 1916 [33] in the transformer loading calculus. Consequently, the same values were adopted subsequently by the IEC 60076-2 [52] and IEC 60354 [4]. The background is further elaborated in Clause G.2. However, these exponents are transformer specific and any suggested values should be used only in absence of transformer-specific values. In addition, it has been found that the recommended winding exponent of 1,6 is quite conservative (see [23], [24] and [45]), and this has been accounted for in this document. This change is still included in this edition as given in Table 4.

Clauses G.2 and G.3 provide methods used to define the winding and oil exponents for specific transformer design.

### Historical background

It was reported by Dulong and Petit in 1817 that the velocity of the cooling due solely to the contact of a gas is proportional to the excess of temperature in degrees centigrade raised to the power 1,233 [33]. Based on this, Swift [22] concluded: "It is fascinating that the reciprocal of 1.223 is approximately 0.8, a value of x commonly used to this day, for natural cooling conditions!".

In 1881, Lorenz derived for convection of heat from vertical plane surface the following relation [33]:

\[P=0,548\times\sqrt[4]{\frac{c_{g}\beta\times k_{\mathrm{B}}}{\nu\times L\times \theta_{\mathrm{m}}}}\times\theta^{0.5}\times\Delta\theta^{1.25}\] (G.1)

where

\(P\): is the loss dissipated per cm\({}^{2}\),

\(c\): is the specific heat of gas at constant pressure,

\(k_{\mathrm{th}}\): is the gas thermal conductivity,

\(v\): is the gas viscosity,

\(\theta_{\mathrm{m}}\): is the gas average temperature,

\(\rho\): is the gas average density,

\(g\): is the gravitational constant,

\(L\): is the height of plane, and

\(\Delta\theta\): is the difference in temperature of plane surface and of the gas at a great distance from the plane.

For the given room temperature, known plate design and for standard atmospheric pressure, the equation is further reduced to:

\[P=C^{te}\times\Delta\theta^{1.25}\] (G.2)

The result of the number of tests conducted by Montgomery [33], where most of the heat is dissipated by convection, was almost the same:
