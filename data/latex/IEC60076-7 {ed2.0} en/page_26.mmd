1,5 times the rated current. Oil expansion and oil pressure could also impose restrictions. Consideration may also have to be given to associated equipment such as cables, circuit breakers, current transformers, etc.

#### 7.4.3 Short-circuit withstand requirements

During or directly after operation at load beyond nameplate rating, transformers can not conform to the thermal short-circuit requirements, as specified in IEC 60076-5 [67], which are based on a short-circuit duration of 2 s. However, the duration of short-circuit currents in service is shorter than 2 s in most cases.

#### 7.4.4 Voltage limitations

Unless other limitations for variable flux voltage variations are known (see IEC 60076-1), the applied voltage should not exceed 1,05 times either the rated voltage (principal tapping) or the tapping voltage (other tappings) on any winding of the transformer.

### Specific limitations for large power transformers

#### 7.5.1 General

For large power transformers, additional limitations, mainly associated with the leakage flux, should be taken into consideration. It is therefore advisable in this case to specify, at the time of enquiry or order, the amount of loading capability needed in specific applications.

As far as thermal deterioration of insulation is concerned, the same calculation method applies to all transformers.

According to present knowledge, the importance of the high reliability of large units in view of the consequences of failure, together with the following considerations, make it advisable to adopt a more conservative, more individual approach here than for smaller units.

* The combination of leakage flux and main flux in the limbs or yokes of the magnetic circuit (see 5.2) makes large transformers more vulnerable to overexcitation than smaller transformers, especially when loaded above nameplate rating. Increased leakage flux may also cause additional eddy-current heating of other metallic parts.
* The consequences of degradation of the mechanical properties of insulation as a function of temperature and time, including wear due to thermal expansion, may be more severe for large transformers than for smaller ones.
* Hot-spot temperatures outside the windings cannot be obtained from a normal temperature-rise test. Even if such a test at a rated current indicates no abnormalities, it is not possible to draw any conclusions for higher currents since this extrapolation may not have been taken into account at the design stage.
* Calculation of the winding hot-spot temperature rise at higher than rated currents, based on the results of a temperature-rise test at rated current, may be less reliable for large units than for smaller ones.

#### 7.5.2 Current and temperature limitations

The load current, hot-spot temperature, top-oil temperature and temperature of metallic parts other than windings and leads but nevertheless in contact with solid insulating material should not exceed the limits stated in Table 2 and Table 3. Moreover, it should be noted that, when the hot-spot temperature exceeds 140 \({}^{\circ}\)C, gas bubbles may develop which could jeopardize the dielectric strength of the transformer (see 5.3).
