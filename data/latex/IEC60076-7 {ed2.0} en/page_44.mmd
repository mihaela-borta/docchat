## Appendix A Insolation life expectancy

Ageing or change of polymerization of paper insulation is often described as a first order process that can be described by the following Arrhenius equation:

\[\frac{1}{DP_{\text{end}}}-\frac{1}{DP_{\text{start}}}=\lambda\times t\times e^{ \frac{E_{\text{A}}}{R\times(\theta_{\text{h}}+273)}}\] (A.1)

where

\(DP_{\text{end}}\) is the insulation DP value at the moment of the sampling or the end of life criterion;

\(DP_{\text{start}}\) is the initial insulation DP value;

\(A\) is the pre-exponential factor in 1/h;

\(E_{\text{A}}\) is the activation energy in kJ/mol;

\(t\) is the life time of a transformer in h;

\(R\) is the gas constant in J/(K-mol);

\(\theta_{\text{h}}\) is the hot-spot temperature, \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Arrhenius extrapolations assume that a chemical degradation process is controlled by a reaction rate \(k\) proportional to \(\exp(-E_{\text{A}}/RT)\), where \(E_{\text{A}}\) is the Arrhenius activation energy, \(R\) the gas constant (8,314 J/(K-mol), \(T\) the absolute temperature and \(A\) the pre-exponential factor. The pre-exponent value \(A\) is a constant depending on the chemical environment. In an Arrhenius plot, the natural logarithm of the ageing rate (ln \(k\)) is plotted against the inverse absolute temperature (_1/T_) and a straight line is obtained as shown in Figure A.1 - illustrating how the ageing rate depends on temperature. The condition for achieving a straight line is that it is the same ageing process over the whole temperature range. The activation energy describes how much the reaction rates depend on temperature; if the ageing process is independent of temperature the activation energy is zero and the line becomes parallel with the \(x\)-axis, while if it increases fast with increasing temperature the line falls quickly. One should bear in mind that \(A\) and \(E_{\text{A}}\) values come in pairs. In principle, \(E_{\text{A}}\) is the slope of the line in Figure A.1, and the \(A\)-value is the value of interception with a virtual \(y\)-axis from 0, the higher the value the higher the location of the curve above the abscissa and the ageing is faster. The point is that a small change in slope will influence the \(A\)-value significantly.
