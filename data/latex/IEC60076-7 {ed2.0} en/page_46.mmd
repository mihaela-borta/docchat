### Relative ageing rate considering oxygen and water effect

In 6.3, the rate of ageing of the interturn insulation of transformers under the effect of time and temperature is referred to a hot-spot temperature of 98 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 110 \({}^{\circ}\)C for the non-thermally and thermally upgraded paper, respectively. Further, the relative ageing rate \(V\) is defined according to Equations (2) and (3). These equations are based on the life expectancy formula of Montsinger [25], and Dakin's ageing rate formula [26], which are a simplification of the more general Arrhenius relation given in Equation (A.1), and valid only in a limited temperature range. On the other hand, the IEEE Loading Guide [27], recommends Equation (3), which is an equivalent to the acceleration ageing factor, \(F_{\text{AA}}\), for a wide range of temperatures. Further, Equations (2) and (3) imply that the ageing rate is only dependent on the hot-spot temperature and do not consider different insulation conditions, which are defined in references [9] to [15].

Therefore, if the ageing rate of the paper insulation is given as follows:

\[k=A\times e^{\frac{E}{R\times(\theta_{\text{h}}+273)}}\] (A.3)

and if an ageing rate at a certain temperature and at an insulation condition is chosen to be the rated one, \(k_{r}\), then the ageing rate, \(k\), determined for any temperature and insulation condition can be related to this rated rate, \(k_{r}\), by a new relative ageing rate, \(V\), given as their ratio [28]:

\[V=\frac{k}{k_{r}}=\frac{A}{A_{r}}e^{\frac{1}{R\times(\frac{E_{r}}{\theta_{\text {h}r}+273}\frac{E}{\theta_{\text{h}}+273})}}\] (A.4)

where

the subscript r stands for the rated condition.

The chosen rated insulation condition for both the non-thermally and thermally upgraded paper is "free from air and 0,5 % moisture" taken from Table A.1. Also, similar to the approach given in Clause 6, the rated relative ageing rate \(V\) = 1,0 at this condition corresponds to a temperature of 98 \({}^{\circ}\)C for non-thermally upgraded paper and to 110 \({}^{\circ}\)C for thermally upgraded paper.
