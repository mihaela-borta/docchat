#### 8.1.3 Direct measurement of hot-spot temperature rise

Fibre optic probes are installed in windings to measure the hot-spot temperature rise. Although local loss densities and oil circulation speeds are calculated, it is very difficult to know where the hot-spot is exactly located. Thus, a certain minimum number of sensors should be installed in a winding. The sensors are inserted in slots in the radial spacers in such a way that there is only the conductor insulation and an additional thin paper layer between the sensor and the conductor metal. Calibrations have shown that a reasonable accuracy is obtained in this way (see [16]).

This minimum number of sensors is selected in such a way that the maximum measured temperature rise is close enough to the real hot-spot temperature rise for a safe operation of the winding. This maximum measured temperature is at the same time considered as the hot-spot of the winding.
