### Ambient temperature

#### 8.3.1 Outdoor air-cooled transformers

For dynamic considerations, such as monitoring or short-time emergency loading, the actual temperature profile should be used directly.

For design and test considerations, the following equivalent temperatures are taken as ambient temperature:

1. the yearly weighted ambient temperature is used for thermal ageing calculation;
2. the monthly average temperature of the hottest month is used for the maximum hot-spot temperature calculation.

NOTE Concerning the ambient temperature, see also IEC 60076-2.

If the ambient temperature varies appreciably during the load cycle, then the weighted ambient temperature is a constant, fictitious ambient temperature which causes the same ageing as the variable temperature acting during that time. For a case where a temperature increase of 6 K doubles the ageing rate and the ambient temperature can be assumed to vary sinusoidally, the yearly weighted ambient temperature, \(\theta_{\text{E}}\), is equal to

\[\theta_{\text{E}}=\theta_{\text{ya}}+0,01\times\left[2\,\left(\theta_{\text{ ma-max}}-\theta_{\text{ya}}\right)\right]^{1,85} \tag{27}\]

where

\(\theta_{\text{ma-max}}\) is the monthly average temperature of the hottest month (which is equal to the sum of the average daily maxima and the average daily minima, measured in \({}^{\circ}\)C, during that month, over 10 or more years, divided by 2);

\(\theta_{\text{ya}}\) is the yearly average temperature (which is equal to the sum of the monthly average temperatures, measured in \({}^{\circ}\)C, divided by 12).

\(\theta_{\text{ma-max}}\) = 30 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 2 months

\(\theta_{\text{ma}}\) = 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 4 months

\(\theta_{\text{ma}}\) = 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 4 months

\(\theta_{\text{ma}}\) = 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 2 months

The ambient temperature used in the calculation examples in Annex J is 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

#### 8.3.2 Correction of ambient temperature for transformer enclosure

A transformer operating in an enclosure experiences an extra temperature rise which is about half the temperature rise of the air in that enclosure.

For transformers installed in a metal or concrete enclosure, \(\Delta\theta_{\text{or}}\) in Equations (10) and (11) should be replaced by \(\Delta\theta_{\text{or}}\) as follows:

\[\Delta\theta_{\text{or}}=\Delta\theta_{\text{or}}+\Delta\big{(}\Delta\theta_{ \text{or}}\big{)} \tag{28}\]

where

\(\Delta\big{(}\Delta\theta_{\text{or}}\big{)}\) is the extra top-oil temperature rise under rated load.

It is strongly recommended that this extra temperature rise be determined by tests, but when such test results are not available, the values given in Table 5 for different types of enclosure
