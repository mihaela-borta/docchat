\[P=C^{te}\times\Delta\theta^{1.245}\] (G.3)

where the constant \(C^{te}\) was determined empirically.

It was then concluded that the convection for vertical surface and within operational range of the temperatures can be expressed by Equation (G.3).

A simple equation rearrangement gives temperature rise variation with loss as follows:

\[\Delta\theta=\tfrac{1}{c^{te}}\times P^{1/1,25}=C_{1}^{te}\times P^{0,8}\] (G.4)

It was found that Equation (G.4) holds for top-oil rise and for horizontal disc coils, but for the vertical/layer winding design the corresponding temperature rise over top-oil varies between 0,9 and the first power of the loss. Now the corresponding temperature rises at any load can be found from the following mathematical expression:

1. Top-oil temperature rise: Based on Equation (G.4), the temperature rise at rated load is expressed as follows: \[\Delta\theta_{or}=C_{1,r}^{te}\times P_{r}^{0,8}\] (G.5) If then Equation (G.4) is divided by Equation (G.5) the following ratio is obtained: \[\tfrac{\Delta\theta_{o}}{\Delta\theta_{or}}=\tfrac{C_{1}^{te}}{C_{1}^{te}} \times\tfrac{P^{0,8}}{P_{r}^{0,8}}\] (G.6) Also, if for given design and operating temperature range the following is defined: \[C^{\bullet}{}_{1,t}=C^{\bullet}{}_{1}\] (G.7
