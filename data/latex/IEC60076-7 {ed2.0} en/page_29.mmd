In core type transformers the hot-spot is generally located at the top of the windings. If the winding is cooled by axial oil circulation, the most probable location is disc number 1 or 2 seen from the top. At zig-zag cooling one of the first 3 top discs is the most probable location. If the winding has tapping discs at its upper half, the hot-spot is probably located in the first current carrying disc above the currentless tapping discs in the (-) tap position. Therefore, it should be noted that the hot-spot location is transformer specific and highly affected by the transformer design. As such, this predetermined location should be discussed during design review.

Experience has shown that there might be gradients of more than 10 K between different sensors in the top of a normal transformer winding. Hence, it is not self-evident that the insertion of, for example, one or two sensors will detect a relevant temperature rise. An example of this is shown in Figure 7[17]. The relative local loss densities compared to the average loss of the winding (which corresponded to the average winding gradient \(g\)) were 156 %, 133 %, etc. The figures indicated in the discs at the right (114 %, 142 %, 156 %, etc.) are the relative local loss densities in per cent of the average loss density of the whole winding that is the total loss of the winding divided by the number of discs. It should be noted that the highest temperature rise of 23,2 K was measured at the relative loss density 117 %, which was far from the highest value 156 %.

For the temperature rise test, the recommended number of sensors to be installed in one phase of ON-, OF-, OD-cooled core type transformers are as follows:

* for transformers with a leakage flux \(\geq\) 400 mWb/phase at the rated current, the number of sensors should be 8 per winding with full rating;
* for transformers with a leakage flux between 150 mWb/phase and 400 mWb/phase at the rated current, the number of sensors should be 6 per winding;
* for transformers with a leakage flux below 150 mWb/phase at the rated current, the number of sensors should be 4 per winding.

The sensors should be installed in the phase for which the warm resistance curve is recorded. However, each user should decide how accurate the hot-spot measurement needs to be for a
