This expression is equivalent to the equation suggested by loading guide where "0,8" refers to the top-oil exponent "\(x\)" giving the final equation for the final top-oil temperature rise at any load as follows: \[\Delta\theta_{o}=\left(\frac{1+R\times x^{2}}{1+R}\right)^{x}\times\Delta\theta_{or}\] (G.14)
2. The hot-spot to top-oil temperature rise By following the same procedure as above for the top-oil temperature rise and knowing that in this case the loss, \(P\), represents only the load loss, \(P_{l}\), the following formula is derived: \[\Delta\theta_{hs-o}=\Delta\theta_{hs-or}\times K^{1,6}\] (G.15) Again, this is the same as the general form suggested in the loading guide where "1,6" refers to the winding exponent "\(y\)", giving the final equation for the final hot-spot temperature rise over top-oil temperature at any load as follows: \[\Delta\theta_{hs-o}=\Delta\theta_{hs-or}\times K^{y}\] (G.16)

### Theoretical approach

Based on heat transfer theory, the natural convection oil flow around vertical, inclined and horizontal plates and cylinders the temperature rise and the average winding to average oil gradient can be obtained from the following empirical correlation (see references [46] to [50]):

\[N_{u}=C\times[G_{r}\times P_{r}]^{n}\] (G.17)

where

\[N_{u}=\frac{h\times l}{\lambda}\] (G.18)

\[P_{r}=\frac{\rho\times v\times c}{\lambda}\] (G.19)

\[G_{r}=\frac{\rho\times\Delta\theta\times g\times l^{2}}{v^{2}}\] (G.20)

where

\(N_{u}\), \(G_{r}\), \(P_{r}\) are Nusselt, Grashof and Prandtl numbers, respectively,

\(C\) and \(n\) are empirical constants affected by oil flow,

\(h\) is the heat transfer coefficient,

\(l\) is the dimension of the heated surface in the direction of flow,

\(\lambda\) is the thermal conductivity,

\(\rho\) is the oil density,

\(v\) is the oil kinematic viscosity,

\(\beta\) is the coefficient of thermal cubic expansion,

\(g\) is the gravitational constant, and

\(\Delta\theta\) is the corresponding surface drop, i.e. temperature gradient.

By substituting Equations (G.18), (G.19) and (G.20) in Equation (G.17), the following expression is obtained:
