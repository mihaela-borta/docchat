Thermal sensors should particularly be installed in:

a): yoke clamp made of magnetic steel, e.g. winding supports, supports for exit leads, yoke clamp extensions at the end of cores with wound outer limbs, and in yoke clamps opposite to the centre line of a phase;

b): flitch-plates and outer core packets opposite to the top of the winding block;

c): in the top yoke, particularly at the top of the centre phase in a 3-phase transformer (Figure 9).

Installation of sensors in the top yoke makes sense only if an extra thermal no-load test is done.

More details about the installation of thermal sensors are given in [18].

#### 8.1.4 Hot-spot factor

The hot-spot factor \(H\) is winding-specific and should be determined on a case-by-case basis when required. Studies show that the factor \(H\) varies within the ranges 1,0 to 2,1 depending on the transformer size, its short-circuit impedance and winding design [19]. The factor \(H\) should be defined either by direct measurement (see 8.1.3 and Annex D) or by a calculation procedure based on fundamental loss and heat transfer principles, and substantiated by direct measurements on production or prototype transformers or windings.

A calculation procedure based on fundamental loss and heat transfer principles should consider the following as given in Annex D, [18], and [20].

a): The fluid flow within the winding ducts, the heat transfer, flow rates and resulting fluid temperature should be modelled for each cooling duct.

b): The distribution of losses within the winding. One of the principal causes of extra local loss in the winding conductors is radial flux eddy loss at the winding ends, where the leakage flux intercepts the wide dimension of the conductors. The total losses in the subject conductors should be determined using the eddy and circulating current losses in
