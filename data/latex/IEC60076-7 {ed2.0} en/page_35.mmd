The two equations are

\[k_{21}\times K^{y}\times(\Delta\theta_{\mathrm{hr}})=k_{22}\times r_{\mathrm{w}} \times\frac{\mathrm{d}\Delta\theta_{\mathrm{h1}}}{\mathrm{d}t}+\Delta\theta_{ \mathrm{h1}} \tag{7}\]

and

\[\left(k_{21}-1\right)\times K^{y}\times(\Delta\theta_{\mathrm{hr}})=(r_{0}\,^{ \prime}k_{22})\times\frac{\mathrm{d}\Delta\theta_{\mathrm{h2}}}{\mathrm{d}t}+ \Delta\theta_{\mathrm{h2}} \tag{8}\]

the solutions of which are combined in accordance with Equation (6).

The final equation for the hot-spot temperature is

\[\theta_{\mathrm{h}}=\theta_{\mathrm{o}}+\Delta\theta_{\mathrm{h}} \tag{9}\]

Regarding Equations (5) to (8), the complexity is in order to account for the fact that the oil-cooling medium has mechanical inertia in addition to thermal inertia. The effect is greatest for natural cooling (ON), somewhat less for non-directed-flow pumped-oil cooling (OF), and negligible for directed-flow pumped-oil cooling (OD), as regards power transformers. It is also negligible for small transformers (see 8.2.2).

NOTE For ON and OF cooling, the oil viscosity change counteracts the effect of the ohmic resistance variation of the conductors. In fact, the cooling effect of the oil viscosity change is stronger than the heating effect of the resistance change. This has been taken into account implicitly by the winding exponent of 1,3 in Table 5. For OD cooling, the influence of the oil viscosity on temperature rises is slight, and the effect of the ohmic resistance variation is considered. An approximate correction term (with its sign) for the hot-spot temperature rise at OD is \(0,15\times(\Delta\theta_{\mathrm{h}}-\Delta\theta_{\mathrm{hr}})\).

#### 8.2.2 Exponential equations solution

**Subclause 8.2.2** describes the exponential equation solution to the heat transfer differential Equations (5) to (8).

An example of a load variation according to a step function is shown in Figure 13 (the details of the example are given in Annex H).
