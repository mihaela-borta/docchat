### 3.5 normal cyclic loading

loading in which a higher ambient temperature or a higher-than-rated load current is applied during part of the cycle, but which, from the point of view of relative thermal ageing rate (according to the mathematical model), is equivalent to the rated load at normal ambient temperature

Note 1 to entry: This is achieved by taking advantage of low ambient temperatures or low load currents during the rest of the load cycle. For planning purposes, this principle can be extended to provide for long periods of time whereby cycles with relative thermal ageing rates greater than unity are compensated for by cycles with thermal ageing rates less than unity.

### long-time emergency loading

loading resulting from the prolonged outage of some system elements that will not be reconnected before the transformer reaches a new and higher steady-state temperature

### short-time emergency loading

unusually heavy loading of a transient nature (less than 30 min) due to the occurrence of one or more unlikely events which seriously disturb normal system loading

### hot-spot

if not specially defined, hottest spot of the windings

### relative thermal ageing rate

for a given hot-spot temperature, rate at which transformer insulation ageing is reduced or accelerated compared with the ageing rate at a reference hot-spot temperature

### transformer insulation life

total time between the initial state for which the insulation is considered new and the final state for which the insulation is considered deteriorated due to thermal ageing, dielectric stress, short-circuit stress, or mechanical movement (which could occur in normal service), and at which a high risk of electrical failure exists

### 3.11 per cent loss of life

equivalent ageing in hours over a time period (usually 24 h) times 100 divided by the expected transformer insulation life

Note 1 to entry: The equivalent ageing in hours is obtained by multiplying the relative ageing rate with the number of hours.

### non-thermally upgraded paper

kraft paper produced from unbleached softwood pulp under the sulphate process without addition of stabilizers

### thermally upgraded paper

cellulose-based paper which has been chemically modified to reduce the rate at which the paper decomposes

Note 1 to entry: Ageing effects are reduced either by partial elimination of water forming agents (as in cyanoethylation) or by inhibiting the formation of water through the use of stabilizing agents (as in amine addition,
