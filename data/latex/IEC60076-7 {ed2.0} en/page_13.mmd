dicyandianide). A paper is considered as thermally upgraded if it meets the life criteria defined in ANSI/IEEE C57.100 [1]1; 50 % retention in tensile strength after 65 000 h in a sealed tube at 110 \({}^{\circ}\)C or any other time/temperature combination given by the equation:

Footnote 1: Numbers in square brackets refer to the bibliography.

\[\text{Time (h)}=e^{\left(\frac{15000}{(h_{1}+273)}-28,082\right)}\approx 65 000\times e^{\left(\frac{15000}{(h_{1}+273)}-\frac{15000}{(110+273)}\right)} \tag{1}\]

Because the thermal upgrading chemicals used today contain nitrogen, which is not present in kraft pulp, the degree of chemical modification is determined by testing for the amount of nitrogen present in the treated paper. Typical values for nitrogen content of thermally upgraded papers are between 1 % and 4 % when measured in accordance with ASTM D-982 [2], but after the sealed tube test.

### non-directed oil flow OF

flow indicating that the pumped oil from heat exchangers or radiators flows freely inside the tank, and is not forced to flow through the windings

Note 1 to entry: The oil flow inside the windings can be either axial in vertical cooling ducts or radial in horizontal cooling ducts with or without zigzag flow.

### non-directed oil flow ON

flow indicating that the oil from the heat exchangers or radiators flows freely inside the tank and is not forced to flow through the windings

Note 1 to entry: The oil flow inside the windings can be either axial in vertical cooling ducts or radial in horizontal cooling ducts with or without zigzag flow.

### directed oil flow OD

flow indicating that the principal part of the pumped oil from heat exchangers or radiators is forced to flow through the windings

Note 1 to entry: The oil flow inside the windings can be either axial in vertical cooling ducts or zigzag in horizontal cooling ducts.

### _directed oil flow OD_

flow indicating that the principal part of the pumped oil from heat exchangers or radiators is forced to flow through the windings

Note 1 to entry: The oil flow inside the windings can be either axial in vertical cooling ducts or zigzag in horizontal cooling ducts.

### _design ambient temperature_

temperature at which the permissible average winding and top-oil and hot-spot temperature over ambient temperature are defined
