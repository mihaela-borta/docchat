### Effects of long-time emergency loading

This is not a normal operating condition and its occurrence is expected to be rare but it may persist for weeks or even months and can lead to considerable ageing.

1. [label=)]
2. Deterioration of the mechanical properties of the conductor insulation will accelerate at higher temperatures. If this deterioration proceeds far enough, it may reduce the effective life of the transformer, particularly if the latter is subjected to system short circuits or transportation events.
3. Other insulation parts, especially parts sustaining the axial pressure of the winding block, could also suffer increased ageing rates at higher temperature.
4. The contact resistance of the tap-changers could increase at elevated currents and temperatures and, in severe cases, thermal runaway could take place.
5. The gasket materials in the transformer may become more brittle as a result of elevated temperatures.

The calculation rules for the relative ageing rate and per cent loss of life are based on considerations of long-term risks.

### Transformer size

The sensitivity of transformers to loading beyond nameplate rating usually depends on their size. As the size increases, the tendency is that:

* the leakage flux density increases;
* the short-circuit forces increase;
* the mass of insulation, which is subjected to a high electric stress, is increased;
* the hot-spot temperatures are more difficult to determine.

Thus, a large transformer could be more vulnerable to loading beyond nameplate rating than a smaller one. In addition, the consequences of a transformer failure are more severe for larger sizes than for smaller units.

Therefore, in order to apply a reasonable degree of risk for the expected duties, this part of IEC 60076 considers three categories:

1. [label=)]
2. small transformers, for which only the hot-spot temperatures in the windings and thermal deterioration should be considered;
3. medium power transformers where the variations in the cooling modes should be considered;
4. large power transformers, where also the effects of stray leakage flux are significant and the consequences of failure are severe.

For hermetically sealed transformers without pressure relief devices the over pressure should be considered to avoid permanent tank deformation during loading beyond nameplate rating.

## 6 Relative ageing rate and transformer insulation life

### General

For the manufacture of paper and pressboard for electrical insulation, mainly unbleached softwood kraft pulp is used. The cellulose is refined from the tree by the so-called "sulphate" or "kraft" process. After processing, the typical composition of unbleached kraft pulp is 78 % to 80 % cellulose, 10 % to 20 % hemicellulose and 2 % to 6 % lignin.

Cellulose is a linear condensation polymer consisting of anhydroglucose joined together by glycosidic bonds, Figure 1.
