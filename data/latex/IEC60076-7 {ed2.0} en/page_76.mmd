At \(n\) = 2, \(t\) = 6 min, the entire calculation is repeated, with all subscripts incremented by 1, that is, each variable \(X_{\{1\}}\) becomes \(X_{\{2\}}\). At \(n\) = 3, \(t\) = 9 min, each variable \(X_{\{2\}}\) becomes \(X_{\{3\}}\) and so on. Continue until \(n\) = 40, \(t\) = 120 min.

## 5 - Tabulate the output data

The results of the calculation are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2.
