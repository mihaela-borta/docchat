independent reference signal that is well-correlated with the primary noise is unavailable [12]. A combination of feedforward and feedback ANC systems is the central idea behind developing a HANC system [2, 13, 14, 15]. It has been found that HANC systems perform best in scenarios, where reference sensors fail to capture the noise completely. The use of a HANC system is desirable in most of the conditions because it offers advantages like flexible structural design and a modular ANC system design where the feedforward subsystem caters to the broadband noise and the feedback part cancels the noise portions that are uncorrelated to the reference input [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In the design of a HANC system, an efficient adaptive algorithm is of utmost importance while considering practical implementation in industrial setups. The FxLMS algorithm in a NANC system has been used extensively due to it's simplicity and ease of implementation, but the slow convergence of the adaptive filter has led to innovations in adaptive control strategies. The FXWALS algorithm was developed in [21] which introduced the idea of using a momentum LMS (MLMS) algorithm for ANC applications. The MLMS algorithm and its variants [22, 23, 24, 25, 26] were primarily used to increase the convergence rate of the stochastic gradient algorithms for enhanced performance of the ANC system. In [27], a new version of the MLMS algorithm was used wherein the cost function of the weighted accumulated mean square error provided smaller variance of the parameter estimates. The MLMS algorithm in combination with the FXLMS algorithm yielded a high speed of convergence and improved tracking capability for a non-stationary signal at the cost of degraded steady-state performance. To improve the overall performance of the NANC system, a variable momentum factor can be used as suggested in [21]. The MLMS algorithm in combination with FXLMS based algorithm has never been used earlier in a HANC system. Hence we extend this idea to a HNAN system for improving the overall performance in a scenario where both correlated and uncorrelated disturbances are present (Table 1).

Here a new adaptive control strategy for the inherent structures in a HNANC system is put forth. The new HNANC system simultaneously controls both correlated and uncorrelated disturbances at a price of a slight increase in the computational load; it also roots out the ambient noises like the firework noises which are the noises that occur abruptly, affecting the ANC system. The new HNANC system consists of three subsystems. a) A conventional feedforward NANC subsystem to cancel the correlated disturbances. b) A supporting adaptive filter whose primary job is to give the most appropriate feedback by addressing the issue of common error for updating the new variable momentum factor. c) A feedback NANC system for cancelling uncorrelated noise and the firework noise. The reason behind using a supporting adaptive filter along with the new variable momentum factor is for generating accurate error/reference signal to the feedforward controller for enhanced steady-state performance of the HNANC system. Also, in the feedforward part, the reference signal needs only two reference input filtering (x-filtering) blocks using a monitored bandpass filterbank which executes irrespective of the presence of multiple frequencies in the signal for faster ANC operation. Numerous simulations are carried out to establish the improvements the proposed HNANC system offers against the existing counterparts considering the overall performance of the HNANC system.

To maintain consistency in presentation, the notation that is standardized for use throughout the article, is given in Table 2. We have also assumed that the secondary path is modeled perfectly. A discrete-time filter of length \(L\) is represented as a polynomial \(H(q)\) in terms of \(q^{-1}\) as \(H(q)=h_{0}+h_{1}q^{-1}+\ldots+h_{L-1}q^{-L+1}\) or by its coefficient vector \(\mathbf{h}=[h_{0},h_{1},\ldots,h_{L-1}]^{T}\). The signal \(u(n)\) is filtered by \(H(q)\) as \(H(q)u(n)=\mathbf{h}^{T}(n)\mathbf{u}(n)\), with \(\mathbf{u}(n)=[u(n),u(n-1),\ldots,u(n-L+1)]^{T}\).

## 2 The NANC system

A conventional NANC system is depicted by the block diagram in Fig. 1. In the block diagram, \(P(z)\) is the primary path and \(\hat{S}(z)\) is the estimate of the secondary path \(S(z)\). In a practical implementation of the NANC system, the signal is acquired using a non-acoustic sensor like a tachometer. This signal is then processed by electronic equipment like microphone and loudspeakers to achieve specific goals for a successful ANC operation [2]. The processing of the acquired signal takes place in the signal processing region through the primary path. The tachometer detects the fundamental frequency of the primary noise and generates a synchronization (sync) signal which in turn triggers the signal generator to produce \(x(k)\), which is the input/reference signal to the adaptive filter. residual error signal \(e(k)\) is picked up by the error sensor. Then the signal \(y(k)\) drives the loudspeaker to generate the cancelling signal to negate the disturbances that are correlated to the reference input. In the block diagram of Fig. 2, a typical feedforward NANC system for the \(i\)th channel is shown. This system is found to be proficient in the removal of the primary noise that contains sinusoidal signals as additive noise. The primary noise to be removed from the system is expressed as

\[p(k)=\sum_{i=1}^{l}[a_{i}\cos(\phi_{i}k)+b_{i}\sin(\phi_{i}k)]+\eta_{p}(k), \tag{1}\]

where \(l\) corresponds to the number of frequency components building up the sine function, \(\phi_{i}\) denoting the frequency of the \(i\)th component and \(\eta_{p}(k)\) is additive white Gaussian noise with variance \(\sigma_{p}^{2}\) and zero mean. The signal frequencies in the secondary source are estimated in a recursive manner, determined by a sync signal that is captured by a non acoustic sensor such as a tachometer. The discrete fourier coefficients (DFCs) of the frequency component are \(\left\{\hat{a}_{i}(k)\mathbf{x}_{n}(k)+\hat{b}_{i}(k)\mathbf{x}_{n}(k)\right\}_{ i=1}^{l}\). The secondary source is given by

\[\begin{array}{ll}y(k)&=\sum_{i=1}^{l}y_{i}(k)\\ &=\sum_{i=1}^{l}\Big{\{}\hat{a}_{i}(k)\mathbf{x}_{n}(k)+\hat{b}_{i}(k) \mathbf{x}_{0}(k)\Big{\}},\end{array} \tag{2}\]
