ues of the constants in all the simulations for the proposed algorithm are taken as per Table 3 and the adaptive filter step sizes are taken as per Table 4.

### Case 1

In the first case, the simulations performed considering a scenario where the ANC system is affected by multiple firework noises are reported. This scenario is considered because an industrial working environment is subjected to multiple disturbances from different directions. To simulate this scenario, the primary noise included six frequencies (\(q=6\)), where \(w_{1}=0.1\pi\), \(w_{2}=0.15\pi\), \(w_{3}=0.2\pi\), \(w_{4}=0.25\pi\), \(w_{5}=0.3\pi\) and \(w_{6}=0.4\pi\). The corresponding DFCs were set as \(a_{1}=0.5\), \(b_{1}=-0.5\), \(a_{2}=1.0\), \(b_{2}=-1.0\), \(a_{3}=1.5\), \(b_{3}=-1.5\), \(a_{4}=2.0\), \(b_{4}=-2.0\), \(a_{5}=2.5\), \(b_{5}=-2.5\) and \(a_{6}=3.0\), \(b_{6}=-3.0\). The uncorrelated narrowband disturbance \(d(k)\) was a signal containing a single frequency signal \(w_{4}=0.12\pi\) and its corresponding DFCs were set to \(a_{4}=0.45\) and \(b_{4}=0.75\). For clarity of presentation and clear indication of the noise canceling performance, the firework noises affecting the system are reported as can be seen in the results of Figs. 5-8. Upon observation of the results, it can be stated that the proposed algorithm removes almost all of the firework noises in the system, but the NANC system and the CHNANC system fail to cancel the firework noises in most cases. The mean square errors (MSE) of the NANC system, the CHNANC system and the proposed algorithm, computed as \(E\left[e(k)^{2}\right]\) are depicted in Fig. 13. As can be seen from the graph, the NANC system converges fastest, and the CHNANC system converges slowest, while the proposed algorithm gives a moderate performance in this regard as it takes more number of iterations for the adaptive filters to converge compared to the NANC system. The active noise reduction (ANR) performance is depicted in Fig. 14, and it can be clearly observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the counterparts significantly. Now, given the performance of the proposed algorithm in the removal of multiple sinusoidal interferences with excellent accuracy, the moderate convergence of the algorithm can be taken as a tradeoff considering the improvements in signal processing and VLSI technologies over the years in developing processors for high-speed computing.

### Case 2

In this case, we consider different specifications of the firework noise and uncorrelated disturbances. To simulate this, the primary noise included three frequencies (\(q=3\)), where \(w_{1}=0.1\pi\), \(w_{2}=0.15\pi\) and \(w_{3}=0.2\pi\). The corresponding DFCs were set as \(a_{1}=0.25,\ b_{1}=-0.25,\ a_{2}=1.0,\ b_{2}=-1.0,\ a_{3}=1.25,\ b_{3}=-1.25\). The uncorrelated narrowband disturbance \(d(k)\) was a signal containing a single frequency signal \(w_{d}=0.5\pi\) and its corresponding DFCs were set to \(a_{4}=0.15\) and \(b_{4}=0.25\). Similar to case 1, it can be seen in the results of Figs. 9-12, where we report only the peaks of the firework noise, the proposed algorithm removes almost all the occurences of firework noises in the system, but the NANC system and the CHNANC system fail to cancel the firework noises in most cases. The mean square errors (MSE) of the NANC system, the CHNANC system and the proposed algorithm, computed as \(E\left[e(k)^{2}\right]\) are depicted in Fig. 15. As it can be seen from the graph, the results are almost similar to that of case 1 and this validates the proposed algorithm. In this case, the ANR performance graph can be seen in Fig. 16, and while both the proposed algorithm and the CHNANC system performs nearly well for this case, the NANC system drastically fails. We have also considered a change in acoustic paths as mentioned earlier for this case to prove the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm against its counterparts which can be seen in Fig. 17, which further establishes consistency in the proposed observations regarding adaptive filter convergence in this paper.
