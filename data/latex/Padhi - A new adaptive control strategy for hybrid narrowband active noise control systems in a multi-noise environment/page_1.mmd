###### Abstract

In this paper, a new hybrid narrowband active noise control (HNANC) system which effectively counters noise from multiple sources is proposed. Usually, active noise control (ANC) systems fail in the event of encountering uncorrelated noise, since such systems mostly are designed to operate when disturbances correlated to the reference signal are present. To deal with the multiple-noise scenario in an industrial environment, a new adaptive control strategy is introduced consisting of three subsystems: 1) a narrowband feedforward controller where we use filtered-x weighted accumulated LMS (FXWALMS) in combination with a new variable momentum factor scheme, 2) a feedback ANC system adapted by the FXLMS algorithm to specifically counter uncorrelated disturbances, and 3) the supporting adaptive filter that has a twofold objective, firstly, to provide appropriate error/reference signals to the noise cancelling adaptive filters and secondly, to provide the most accurate energy estimate of the constrained error signal for the variable momentum factor to improve the steady state performance of the feedforward controller. For improved adaptive filter convergence, we also reduce the number of reference signal filtering blocks in the feedforward NANC controller. A detailed mathematical analysis of the hybrid structure is performed to establish the basis for the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulations show that the proposed HNANC system gives an improved overall ANC performance over that of existing counterparts.

## 1 Introduction

Industrial machinery such as cutting machines, electric motors, diesel-powered engines, fans and other types of rotating machines usually produce disturbances that can be accurately modeled mathematically by a sinusoidal function. The low frequency and narrowband components of the noise must be suppressed for comfortable user experience for machine operators. A few techniques following the principle of passive noise control (PNC) were first designed to counter these disturbances, but gradually narrowband ANC (NANC) techniques were proven to be most effective and viable for implementation in an industrial environment. The reason behind this is that PNC techniques need bulky hardware to implement without giving appreciable noise cancelling performance and hence was not worth the investment.

Research in ANC technology was initiated in the year 1936 by Paul Lueg [1], who established the basis for generating a silencing effect to cancel the unwanted sound using the acoustical properties of waves. Over the years, many structural developments in the design of ANC systems have taken place. The most effective and practical ANC systems have considered adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filters adapted by a filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm [2; 3; 4; 5; 6]. Other systems with variants of the LMS, recursive least squares (RLS) and Kalman filtering algorithms in combination with adaptive FIR filters were also developed to obtain a tradeoff between noise cancelling performance and computational complexity [7]. The noise generated by industrial machinery usually occurs periodically, and hence are modeled as sinusoidal noise [8]. The types of noise which can be modeled by a periodic function can be effectively cancelled by NANC systems [9; 10; 11]. The ANC systems are generally classified by the frequency characteristics of the ambient noise into broadband ANC (BANC) and NANC systems [11]. Apart from these two types of ANC systems, several hybrid ANC (HANC) systems have been developed to counter multiple noise scenarios, generally in cases where an
